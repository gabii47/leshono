# Offline-only vs Accounts+Sync (what it means)

## Offline-only (recommended for v1)
- No login.
- All lessons + progress are stored on the device.
- Pros: fastest to build, cheapest, works without internet.
- Cons: if you change phone, progress doesn't transfer.

## Accounts + Sync
- Users can create an account (email/Apple/Google) and sync progress.
- Pros: progress follows the user across devices.
- Cons: requires backend, auth, privacy policy, more complexity.

## Recommended path
Start offline-first, then add accounts+sync once the course and exercise engine are solid.
