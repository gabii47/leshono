# Fonts (Serto / Syriac)

We will include the Serto font files in the repo under:
- `apps/turoyo_lingo/assets/fonts/`

Then register them in Flutter `pubspec.yaml` and use them via `TextStyle(fontFamily: ...)`.

## What I need from you
Please upload the font files here (or tell me their local file paths), for both:
- Windows version (likely .ttf/.otf)
- macOS version (likely .ttf/.otf or .ttc)

Once present, I'll add them to the Flutter app and set up a "Script toggle" (Syriac/Latin/Both).
