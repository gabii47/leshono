# Style & Organization

- Keep all source under this repo; no ad-hoc files on Desktop.
- One canonical content source in `content/source/`.
- Generated artifacts go to `content/generated/` (never edited by hand).
- App code must be modular (exercise engine as a package).
- All decisions documented in `docs/decisions/` (ADRs).
