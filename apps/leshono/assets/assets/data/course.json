To avoid discussions about this issue in the English version we use the term ‘Syriacs’. In other languages, we use one of the accepted common terms.

The actual subject (here: u zlam ܙܠܰܐܡ ܐܘ „ the man”) is not expressed in the passive. It is replaced by a new subject ( u ḥabušo ܐܘ ܚܰܒܘܫܐ „der Apfel“). In this way, it is expressed that the apple became peeled. Whoever peeled the apple plays no role.

His title also expresses this connotation, although many of the games discussed in his book can be considered sport activities. In some villages, there were games or sports that were more common than in other villages. For instance, in around the 1960s some people from the village Mzizaḥ saw men from Mёḏyaḏ running. The people of Mzizaḥ did not know why these men were running and shouted at them: “Stop, stop, what is wrong, why are you running?” Among themselves, they thought most probably Kurds were chasing them and that is why they are running away so fast. However, the men from Mёḏyaḍ tried to explain that they were doing sports, and that they were running because they wanted to become fit."

In Turabdin, people got married at a very young age, even before the age of 18. In addition, often the marriages were arranged. However, in some cases there were also marriages resulting from lovers who eloped, against the will of their parents. Often, as long as they managed to get their marriage blessed by a priest elsewhere, they would return and live happily in their village. Syriacs living in Western countries have copied the local traditions of marriage. They have started to get married at a much older age because of pursuing higher education and because of their career. They also want to decide for themselves whom to get married to, although parents will always try to influence them somehow. Moreover, after the marriage ceremony in the church, the party that follows thereafter is often organised for hundreds of people with a full dinner and dancing until after midnight. Due to the dispersion of family members, people often travel abroad to participate in each other’s weddings. This is another occasion for a dispersed community to meet and engage with each other."
