Transitive verbs are verbs that take on one or more objects, like goraš/gur š- (grëš -) ܓܳܪܰܫ ܇ ܓܘܪܫـ ( ܓܪܷܫـ ) “to pull something”. Intransitive verbs do not allow a direct object, like domax/ dëmx- ( damëx - ) ܕܳܡܰܟܼ: ܕܷܡܟ݂ـ ( ܕܰܡܷܟ݂ـ ) “to sleep”. The preterite base of transitive verbs only appears in one form (e.g. grë š - ܓܪܷܫـ ‚to pull‘), the preterite base of intransitive verbs, however, can appear in two forms ( damëx -/ damix- ܕܰܡܷܟ݂ـ ܇ ܕܰܡܝܟ݂ـ ‚to sleep‘). 1. Transitive verbs In order to indicate the grammatical persons, the following suffixes are appended to the preterite base of transitive verbs grë š- ܓܪܷܫـ : Singular Plural 3 rd Person (m.) -le ـܠܶܗ - C e ــܶܗ 3 rd Person (f.) -la ـܠܰܗ 2 nd Person (m.) -lux ـܠܘܟ݂ -xu ـܟ݂ܘ 2 nd Person (f.) -lax ـܠܰܟ݂ 1 st Person - l i ـܠܝ -lan ـܠܰܢ ‘C e’ of the 3 rd person plural means that the final consonant of the preterite base is doubled and / –e / is added. Therefore, /C/ represents the respective consonant.Applied to grë š- ܓܪܷܫـ the 3 rd person plural is grë šš e ܓܪܷܫܫܶܗ „they pulled“. As opposed to the present and future tense, transitive verbs in the preterite do not distinguish between masculine and feminine in the 1st person, but they do distinguish gender in the 2 nd and 3 rd person singular. The preterite of transitive verbs is formed as follows: Singular Plural 3 rd Person (m.) grëšle he pulled ܓܪܷܫܠܶܗ grëšše they pulled ܓܪܷܫܫܶܗ 3 rd Person (f.) grëšla she pulled ܓܪܷܫܠܰܗ 2 nd Person (m.) grëšlux you (m.) pulled ܓܪܷܫܠܘܟ݂ grëšxu you (pl.) pulled ܓܪܷܫܟ݂ܘ 2 nd Person (f.) grëšlax you (f.) pulled ܓܪܷܫܠܰܟ݂ 1 st Person grëšli I pulled ܓܪܷܫܠܝ grëšlan we pulled ܓܪܷܫܠܰܢ Examples for transitive verbs in the preterite: Saro zwënla čanṭa Saro bought a bag ܣܰܪܐ ܙܘܷܢܠܰܗ ܫ̰ܰܢܛܰܐ hënne nqëlle lu bayto ḥaṯo they moved into the new house ܗܷܢܢܶܐ ܢܩܷܠܠܶܗ ܠܘ ܒܰܝܬܐ ܚܰܬ݂ܐ šrëḥle u mede dë ršëmle he explained what he was drawing ܫܪܷܚܠܶܗ ܐܘ ܡܶܕܶܐ ܕܷܪܫܷܡܠܶܗ u aršitakt ršëmle plan the architect drew a plan ܐܘ ܐܰܪܫܝܬܰܟܬ ܪܫܷܡܠܶܗ ܦ݁ܠܰܢ u Aday ftëḥle rastorant Aday opened up a restaurant ܐܘ ܐܰܕܰܝ ܦܬܷܚܠܶܗ ܪܰܣܬܳܪܰܢܬ 2. Intransitive verbs In order to indicate the persons the following suffixes are appended to the preterite base of intransitive verbs damëx - ܕܰܡܷܟ݂ـ / damix- ܕܰܡܝܟ݂ـ : Singular Plural 3 rd Person (m.) -- - -i ـܝ 3 rd Person (f.) -o ـܐ 2 nd Person -at ـܬ -itu ـܝܬܘ 1 st Person (m.) -no ـܢܐ -ina ـܝܢܰܐ 1 st Person (f.) - ono ـܳܢܐ These suffixes are identical with those in the present tense (cf. Grammar 7a). Hence, it is to be distinguished in the singular between masculine and feminine in the 3 rd and 1 st person, but not in the 2 nd person. Using the example of damëx ܕܰܡܷܟ݂ـ /dam i x- ܕܰܡܝܟ݂ـ „to sleep“ the preterite of intransitive verbs is formed as follows: Singular Plural 3 rd Person (m.) damëx he slept ܕܰܡܷܟ݂ damix i they slept ܕܰܡܝܟ݂ܝ 3 rd Person (f.) damix o she slept ܕܰܡܝܟ݂ܐ 2 nd Person damix at you slept ܕܰܡܝܟ݂ܰܬ damix itu you slept ܕܰܡܝܟ݂ܝܬܘ 1 st Person (m.) damëx no I (m.) slept ܕܰܡܷܟ݂ܢܐ damix ina we slept ܕܰܡܝܟ݂ܝܢܰܐ 1 st Person (f.) damix ono I (f.) slept ܕܰܡܝܟ݂ܳܢܐ Examples for the preterite of intransitive verbs: šafëc mëdde d šato approximately one year passed by ܫܰܦܷܥ ܡܷܕܕܶܐ ܕܫܰܬܐ šamici i tašciṯo they heard the story ܫܰܡܝܥܝ ܐܝ ܬܰܫܥܝܬ݂ܐ ayko yalifat Holandoyo? where did you learn Dutch? ܐܰܝܟܐ ܝܰܠܝܦܰܬ ܗܳܠܰܢܕܳܝܐ؟ qadër maxla ṣ ruḥe he could rescue himself ܩܰܕܷܪ ܡܰܟ݂ܠܰܨ ܪܘܚܶܗ aḥna yalifina u lišono we learned the language ܐܰܚܢܰܐ ܝܰܠܝܦܝܢܰܐ ܐܘ ܠܝܫܳܢܐ b) The numerals The cardinal and ordinal numerals are introduced under paragraph ‘Counting – Bnoyo ܒܢܳܝܐ ” in this lesson. It is important to note that both the cardinal and the ordinal numbers from 1 to 10 have a feminine and a masculine form. The feminine form precedes feminine nouns and the masculine form precedes masculine nouns. From two on, that, which is counted, is always in the plural. Cardinal numbers: f. m. ḥḏo aṯto a woman/one woman ܚܕ݂ܐ ܐܰܬ݂ܬܐ ḥa gawro a man/one man ܚܰܐ ܓܰܘܪܐ tarte ni š e two women ܬܰܪܬܶܐ ܢܝܫܶܐ tre gawre two men ܬܪܶܐ ܓܰܘܪܶܐ tlëṯ niše three women ܬܠܷܬ݂ ܢܝܫܶܐ tloṯo gawre three men ܬܠܳܬ݂ܐ ܓܰܘܪܶܐ For 21-29, 31-39, 41-49 etc. the order is unit-and-ten: ḥa w cësri ܚܰܐ ܘܥܷܣܪܝ „twenty-one“.

Prepositions in general The most common prepositions are b ܒـ “in”, bëṯr ܒܷܬ݂ܪ ”behind”, cal ܥܰܠ “on”, cam ܥܰܡ “with”, gab ܓܰܒ “at, next, to”, l ܠـ “for, to, into”, laf ܠܰܦ “toward(s)”, m ܡـ , me ܡܶܐ “from, of, out of”, qëm ܩܷܡ “in front of”, s ܣـ , se ܣܶܐ “at, next to”, taḥt ܬܰܚܬ „under“. Short prepositions are written in one word with the article: b- / ܒـ bu bayto ܒܘ ܒܰܝܬܐ „in the house“, bi qriṯo ܒܝ ܩܪܝܬ݂ܐ „in the village“, bak karme ܒܰܟ ܟܰܪܡܶܐ „in the vineyards“ l- / ܠـ lu bayto ܠܘ ܒܰܝܬܐ „into the house“, li qriṯo ܠܝ ܩܪܝܬ݂ܐ „into the village“, lak karme ܠܰܟ ܟܰܪܡܶܐ „into the vineyards“ m- / ܡـ mu bayto ܡܘ ܒܰܝܬܐ „from/out of the house“ , mi qriṯo ܡܝ ܩܪܝܬ݂ܐ „from/out of the village“, mak karme ܡܰܟ ܟܰܪܡܶܐ „from/out of the vineyards“ s- / ܣـ su bayto ܣܘ ܒܰܝܬܐ „at the house“, si qriṯo ܣܝ ܩܪܝܬ݂ܐ „next to the village“, sak karme ܣܰܟ ܟܰܪܡܶܐ „next to the vineyards“ 2. Prepositions with suffixes Prepositions can take on personal pronominal suffixes. In doing so, the prepositions may alter. The personal pronominal suffixes that are appended to the prepositions correspond to the possessive suffixes of the restricted series introduced in Grammar 5a.2. Preceding the suffixes, the prepositions appear as follows: Preposition Preposition with suffix b ܒـ eb- / ab- ܐܶܒـ ܆ ܐܰܒـ l ܠـ el- / al- ܐܶܠـ ܆ ܐܰܠـ m ܡـ mën- / men- ܡܷܢـ ܆ ܡܶܢـ cal ܥܰܠ acl- ܐܰܥܠـ cam ܥܰܡ acm- ܐܰܥܡـ s ܣـ sid- / sëd- ܣܝܕ ܆ ܣܷܕ bëṯr ܒܷܬ݂ܪ „behind“ and ṭaḥt ܬܰܚܬ „under“ are either used in combination with personal pronominal suffixes or they precede a noun with a definite article:

The following table provides a summary of all of the forms for the present and preterite bases in all of the three active verb stems: Present Base Preterite Base I goraš-, gurš- grёš- to pull ܓܳܪܰܫـ، ܓܘܪܫـ ܓܪܷܫـ domax-, dёmx- damёx-, damix- to sleep ܕܳܡܰܟ݂ـ، ܕܷܡܟ݂ـ ܕܰܡܷܟ݂ـ، ܕܰܡܝܟ݂ـ Note: As previously mentioned in G.8a, the verbs in the “intransitive verb” category, such as domax – dam ёx „to sleep“ are inflected in the preterite form with the help of the present inflectional suffixes. II mḥalaq- , mḥalq- mḥalaq- to throw away ܡܚܰܠܰܩـ , ܡܚܰܠܩـ ܡܚܰܠܰܩـ msamaḥ- , msamḥ- msamaḥ- to forgive ܡܣܰܡܰܚـ , ܡܣܰܡܚـ ܡܣܰܡܰܚـ III madmax- , madamx- madmax- to put to sleep ܡܰܕܡܰܟ݂ـ , ܡܰܕܰܡܟ݂ـ ܡܰܕܡܰܟ݂ـ maltam- , malatm- maltam- to collect ܡܰܠܬܰܡـ , ܡܰܠܰܬܡـ ܡܰܠܬܰܡـ Only a few verb roots appear in all three stems, that can have different meanings for each stem, such as: ḥlq ܚܠܩ I: ḥolaq - ḥlёqle ܚܳܠܰܩ - ܚܠܷܩܠܶܗ „to shave; to cut hair“; ḥlq ܚܠܩ II: m ḥalaq - mḥalaqle ܡܚܰܠܰܩ - ܡܚܰܠܰܩܠܶܗ „to throw, to throw away“; ḥlq ܚܠܩ III: ma ḥlaq - maḥlaqle ܡܰܚܠܰܩ - ܡܰܚܠܰܩܠܶܗ „to let shave; to have hair cut“. Usually the first stem carries the base meaning of the verb. The second stem is designated as an intensifier, and in fact, the majority of loan words are formed according to Stem II, even when the base meaning manifests as a verb. In this manner, a Stem II verb can carry the base meaning. The meaning of Stem III verbs is simpler to determine, because they can almost all be included in the category causative verbs. These verbs imply the meaning “to have (sth.) made or done, to cause (sth.) to do”. Several examples as illustration: 1) grš ܓܪܫ I goraš – grёšle ܓܳܪܰܫ - ܓܪܷܫܠܶܗ „to pull, drag“ III magraš – magrašle ܡܰܓܪܰܫ - ܡܰܓܪܰܫܠܶܗ „to have pulled, drawn“ 2) dcr ܕܥܪ I docar – dacёr ܕܳܥܰܪ - ܕܰܥܷܪ „to turn around, return“ III madcar – madcarle ܡܰܕܥܰܪ – ܡܰܕܥܰܪܠܶܗ „to bring back; to have (sth.) brought back“ Some verbs exist in the second and third stems with the same meaning: 3) kml ܟܡܠ I komal – kamёl ܟܳܡܰܠ - ܟܰܡܷܠ „to end (intr.), to draw to an end“ II mkamal – mkamele ܡܟܰܡܰܠ - ܡܟܰܡܶܠܶܗ „to end (tr.), to bring to an end“ III makmal – makmele ܡܰܟܡܰܠ - ܡܰܟܡܶܠܶܗ „to end (tr.), to bring to an end“ 4) b šl ܒܫܠ I bošal – bašёl ܒܳܫܰܠ - ܒܰܫܷܠ „to be cooked, to be ripe“ II mbašal – mbašele ܡܒܰܫܰܠ - ܡܒܰܫܶܠܶܗ „to cook (tr.)“ III mabšal – mabšele ܡܰܒܫܰܠ - ܡܰܒܫܶܠܶܗ „to cook (tr.)“ Indeed, there are also Stem III verbs that are not directly a causative version of Stem I verbs, as is the case in: qr ṭ ܩܪܛ I: qora ṭ - qrәṭle ܩܳܪܰܛ - ܩܪܷܛܠܶܗ „to nibble“ but qr ṭ ܩܪܛ III: maqra ṭ - maqraṭle ܡܰܩܪܰܛ - ܡܰܩܪܰܛܠܶܗ „to have breakfast“ b) The verbal inflection in Stem II 1) Present inflection In Stem II the present base has the form mḥalaq- ܡܚܰܠܰܩـ or m ḥalq - ܡܚܰܠܩـ , on which the rest of the inflectional suffixes of the present (see G.7a) are attached, in order to form the inflected base form of the present. mḥalaq- ܡܚܰܠܰܩـ is the base of consonant-initial inflectional suffixes, and mḥalq - ܡܚܰܠܩـ is the base of vowel-initial inflectional suffixes: Singular Plural 3. P. (m.) mḥalaq ܡܚܰܠܰܩ mḥalq i ܡܚܰܠܩܺܝ 3. P. (f.) mḥalq o ܡܚܰܠܩܳܐ 2. P. mḥalq at ܡܚܰܠܩܰܬ mḥalq itu ܡܚܰܠܩܺܝܬܘ 1. P. (m.) mḥalaq no ܡܚܰܠܰܩܢܳܐ mḥalq ina ܡܚܰܠܩܺܝܢܰܐ 1. P. (f.) mḥalq ono ܡܚܰܠܩܳܢܳܐ Note: As already discussed in G.7a, the present-marker ko - ܟܳـ is used to indicate present in these forms, and the future-marker g ёd ܓܷܕ is prefixed to indicate future. Example sentences for the present in Stem II: Aydarbo komcayḏitu riša d šato b Holanda? How do you (pl.) celebrate the New Year in the Netherlands? ܐܰܝܕܰܪܒܳܐ ܟܳܡܥܰܝܕܺܝܬܘ ܪܺܝܫܰܗ ܕܫܰܬܳܐ ܒܗܳܠܰܢܕܰܐ؟ Aydarbo komḥaḏritu ruḥayxu? How do you prepare yourselves? ܐܰܝܕܰܪܒܳܐ ܟܳܡܚܰܕ݂ܪܺܝܬܘ ܪܽܘܚܰܝܟ݂ܽܘ؟ Hawxa k omcalqo kul mede b dukṯe. In this way, she hangs everything in its place. ܗܰܘܟ݂ܰܐ ܟܳܡܥܰܠܩܐ ܟܘܠ ܡܶܕܶܐ ܒܕܘܟܬ݂ܶܗ. Example sentences for the future in Stem II: Tamo gёd m šamsina. We will sunbathe there. ܬܰܡܐ ܓܷܕ ܡܫܰܡܣܝܢܰܐ. Adyawma gёd m jarab i raḏayto ḥaṯto. He will test drive the new car today. ܐܰܕܝܰܘܡܰܐ ܓܷܕ ܡܔܰܪܰܒ ܐܝ ܪܰܕ݂ܰܝܬܐ ܚܰܬ݂ܬܐ. Gёd mbadli aj julaṯṯe. They will change clothes. ܓܷܕ ܡܒܰܕܠܝ ܐܰܔ ܔܘܠܰܬ݂ܬ݂ܶܗ. 2) Preterite inflection The preterite has the base mḥalaq ܡܚܰܠܰܩ in Stem II just as the present. The inflectional suffixes of the preterite, the so-called L-suffixes, attach to this. Thus, the preterite paradigm in Stem II follows the example of mḥalaq- ܡܚܰܠܰܩـ : Singular Plural 3. P. (m . ) mḥalaq le ܡܚܰܠܰܩܠܶܗ mḥalaq qe ܡܚܰܠܰܩܩܶܗ 3. P. (f . ) mḥalaq la ܡܚܰܠܰܩܠܰܗ 2. P. (m . ) mḥalaq lux ܡܚܰܠܰܩܠܘܟܼ mḥalaq xu ܡܚܰܠܰܩܟ݂ܘ 2. P. (f . ) mḥalaq lax ܡܚܰܠܰܩܠܰܟܼ 1. P. mḥalaq li ܡܚܰܠܰܩܠܝ mḥalaq lan ܡܚܰܠܰܩܠܰܢ Note: In contrast to Stem I, there is no distinction in Stem II between transitive and intransitive verbs. Examples for the preterite in Stem II: Mšaralle bu muklo w bu štoyo. They began to eat and to drink. ܡܫܰܪܰܠܠܶܗ ܒܽܘ ܡܘܟܠܐ ܘ ܒܘ ܫܬܳܝܐ. Mcayaḏḏe riša d šato cam ḥḏoḏe .

How do you pass the night? ܐܰܝܕܰܪܒܐ ܟܳܡܰܫܰܦܥܝܬܘ ܐܘ ܠܰܠܝܐ؟ 2) Preterite inflection As in Stem II the preterite in Stem III also has only one base, maltam- ܡܰܠܬܰܡـ and the form corresponds to the present. A distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs does not exist. With the inflectional suffixes using the example maltam ܡܰܠܬܰܡ the preterite has the following forms: Singular Plural 3. P. (m . ) m altam le ܡܰܠܬܰܡܠܶܗ m altam me ܡܰܠܬܰܡܡܶܗ 3. P. (f . ) m altam la ܡܰܠܬܰܡܠܰܗ 2. P. (m.) m altam lux ܡܰܠܬܰܡܠܘܟܼ m altam xu ܡܰܠܬܰܡܟ݂ܘ 2. P. (f.) m altam lax ܡܰܠܬܰܡܠܰܟܼ 1.

They put up a Christmas tree. ܡܰܪܟܰܘܘܶܗ ܐܝ ܕܰܘܡܐ ܕܘ ܥܶܕ݂ܐ. b) The passive verb stems and the passive ver b 1. Alongside the active, there are also three passive verb stems in Surayt. As each of the passive verb stems can correspond to an active verb stem, they are designated with Ip, IIp, and IIIp. These stems can be interpreted as the continuation of the t-stems of old Aramaic, namely Eṯpʿel ܐܶܬ݂ܦܥܶܠ (= Ip), Eṯpaʿʿal ܐܶܬ݂ܦ݁ܰܥܰܠ (=IIp) and Ettafʿal ܐܶܬ݁ܬ݁ܰܦ݂ܥܰܠ (IIIp). The principle of conjugation in the passive verb stems corresponds to that in the active verb stems. The passive stems have their own inflectional bases. During inflection, the passive verbs take the same suffix series as the present in both the present and the preterite (see G.7a). In this regard, they are similar to the intransitive verbs. The following table provides an overview of the present and preterite bases in passive verb stems in comparison to the active forms: Present Base Preterite Base I goraš-, gurš-/gёrš- grёš- to pull, drag ܓܳܪܰܫـ , ܓܘܪܫـ/ܓܷܪܫـ ܓܪܷܫـ Ip mёgraš-, mёgroš- grёš-, griš- to be pulled ܡܷܓܪܰܫـ , ܡܷܓܪܳܫـ ܓܪܷܫـ , ܓܪܝܫـ II mzaban-, mzabn- mzaban- to sell ܡܙܰܒܰܢـ , ܡܙܰܒܢـ ܡܙܰܒܰܢـ IIp mizaban-, mizabn- mzaban-, mzabn- to be sold ܡܝܙܰܒܰܢـ, ܡܝܙܰܒܢـ ܡܙܰܒܰܢـ, ܡܙܰܒܢـ III macmar-, macmr- macmar- to build ܡܰܥܡܰܪـ, ܡܰܥܡܪـ ܡܰܥܡܰܪـ IIIp mitacmar-, mitacmr- mtacmar-, mtacmr- to be built ܡܝܬܰܥܡܰܪـ, ܡܝܬܰܥܡܪـ ܡܬܰܥܡܰܪـ, ܡܬܰܥܡܪـ The first form precedes consonant-initial inflectional suffixes, and the second precedes vowel-initial inflectional suffixes. In IIIp (as also in III) if the base precedes a vowel-initial suffix, it can have a free variant with a break in the consonant cluster, present: mitac a mr- ܡܝܬܰܥܰܡܪـ and preterite: mtac a mr- ܡܬܰܥܰܡܪـ . 2. For each active verb, a passive verb can be formed. The active verb expresses active voice, for example u zlam koqolaf u ḥabušo ܐܘ ܙܠܰܐܡ ܟܳܩܳܠܰܦ ܐܘ ܚܰܒܘܫܐ „the man peels the apple“. The passive verb describes the action from another perspective. The actual subject (here: u zlam ܙܠܰܐܡ ܐܘ „ the man”) is not expressed in the passive. It is replaced by a new subject ( u ḥabušo ܐܘ ܚܰܒܘܫܐ „der Apfel“). In this way, it is expressed that the apple became peeled. Whoever peeled the apple plays no role. When necessary, this can be supplemented with help from mu ṭaraf d- ܕ ܡܘ ܛܰܪܰܦ „by way of“ or the abbreviated me- ܡܶܐ „through, by, via“: u ḥabušo komёqlaf mu ṭaraf du zlam ܐܘ ܚܰܒܘܫܐ ܟܳܡܷܩܠܰܦ ܡܘ ܛܰܪܰܦ ܕܘ ܙܠܰܐܡ or u ḥabušo komёqlaf mu zlam ܐܘ ܚܰܒܘܫܐ ܟܳܡܷܩܠܰܦ ܡܘ ܙܠܰܐܡ „the apple is peeled by the man“. 3. Several intransitive and reflexive verbs are formed in the same manner as passive verbs. High frequency verbs such as m ёjġal – jġil ܡܷܔܓ݂ܰܠ - ܔܓ݂ܝܠ „to speak“, mibaṭ - biṭ ܡܝܒܰܛ - ܒܝܛ „to explode“, m ёfṣaḥ - fṣiḥ ܡܷܦܨܰܚ - ܦܨܝܚ „to be happy“, m ёfraš – friš ܡܷܦܪܰܫ - ܦܪܝܫ „to separate, break off“ also belong in this category. c) Verb inflexion in passive stem I 1. Present inflection The regular verbs of the passive Stem I are inflected in the present according to the example of m ёfham – fhim ܡܷܦܗܰܡ - ܦܗܝܡ ( fhm ܦܗܡ Ip) „to be understood“ as follows: Singular Plural 3. P. (m.) mëfham ܡܷܦܗܰܡ mëfhomi ܡܷܦܗܳܡܺܝ 3. P. (f.) mëfhomo ܡܷܦܗܳܡܳܐ 2. P. mëfhomat ܡܷܦܗܳܡܰܬ mëfhomitu ܡܷܦܗܳܡܺܝܬܘ 1. P. (m.) mëfhamno ܡܷܦܗܰܡܢܳܐ mëfhomina ܡܷܦܗܳܡܺܝܢܰܐ 1. P. (f.) mëfhomono ܡܷܦܗܳܡܳܢܳܐ Examples of passive Stem I in the present: Gёd mёzwono i raḏaytayḏux adyawma. Today your (m.) car will be sold. ܓܷܕ ܡܷܙܘܳܢܐ ܐܝ ܪܰܕ݂ܰܝܬܰܝܕ݂ܘܟ݂ ܐܰܕܝܰܘܡܰܐ. Lo komёfhomitu. Nobody understands you (pl.); you (pl.) are not understood. ܠܐ ܟܳܡܷܦܗܳܡܝܬܘ. Komëqroyo i egarṯo w komëzmori aq qole. The letter is read and the songs are sung. ܟܳܡܷܩܪܳܝܐ ܐܝ ܐܶܓܰܪܬ݂ܐ ܘܟܳܡܷܙܡܳܪܝ ܐܰܩ ܩܳܠܶܐ. Intransitive verbs: Kibi mёjġolono acme? Can I (f.) speak with him? ܟܝܒܝ ܡܷܔܓ݂ܳܠܳܢܐ ܐܰܥܡܶܗ؟ Lo mёḥzonat! Don’t be sad! ܠܐ ܡܷܚܙܳܢܰܬ! Kolozam mёṯnoḥat bu bayto. You must rest at home. ܟܳܠܳܙܰܡ ܡܷܬ݂ܢܳܚܰܬ ܒܘ ܒܰܝܬܐ. 2. Preterite inflection The base of the preterite in passive Stem I verbs is identical to that of the active Stem I verbs. Indeed the passive verbs in the preterite take the same inflectional suffixes as those of the present. Here is the paradigm of the example fhim ܦܗܝܡ „to be understood“: Singular Plural 3. P. (m.) fhim ܦܗܝܡ fhimi ܦܗܝܡܝ 3. P. (f.) fhimo ܦܗܝܡܐ 2. P. fhimat ܦܗܝܡܰܬ fhimitu ܦܗܝܡܝܬܘ 1. P. (m.) fhëmno ܦܗܷܡܢܐ fhimina ܦܗܝܡܝܢܰܐ 1. P. (f.) fhimono ܦܗܝܡܳܢܐ Note: The / i / in the third person m.sg. ( fh im ܦܗܝܡ , griš ܓܪܝܫ , jġil ܔܓ݂ܝܠ etc.) is, contrary to the rule for closed syllables, always long. Examples of the preterite passive Stem I: Mir ele, mёṯnaḥ! He was told, rest! ܡܝܪ ܐܶܠܶܗ، ܡܷܬ݂ܢܰܚ! Hiya nafilo w twiro druca. She fell down and her arm broke. ܗܝܝܰܐ ܢܰܦܝܠܐ ܘ ܬܘܝܪܐ ܕܪܘܥܰܗ. Aṯmёl hiw u darmono. Yesterday the medicine was administered. ܐܰܬ݂ܡܷܠ ܗܝܘ ܐܘ ܕܰܪܡܳܢܐ. Tamo zbiṭina w law qadirina ducrina lu bayto. There we were captured and could no longer return home. ܬܰܡܐ ܙܒܝܛܝܢܰܐ ܘܠܰܘ ܩܰܕܝܪܝܢܰܐ ܕܘܥܪܝܢܰܐ ܠܘ ܒܰܝܬܐ. Sxiri aš šaboke. The window were shut. ܣܟ݂ܝܪܝ ܐܰܫ ܫܰܒܳܟܶܐ. Ftiḥ u tarco.

Preterite inflection The base of the preterite in passive Stem II is pronounced mzaban - ܡܙܰܒܰܢـ before consonant-initial inflectional suffixes, and mzabn - ܡܙܰܒܢـ before vowel-initial inflectional suffixes. Here the preterite inflection of mzaban- ܡܙܰܒܰܢـ „to be sold“ is exemplified: Singular Plural 3. P. (m.) mzaban ܡܙܰܒܰܢ mzabn i ܡܙܰܒܢܝ 3. P. (f.) mzabn o ܡܙܰܒܢܐ 2.

I (f) was expelled from the disco. ܡܚܰܠܩܳܢܐ ܡܘ ܕܝܤܟܐ. b) Verbal inflection in passive stem III The passive verb in the third stem is identified by an infixed -t- ـܬـ . As in the passive Stem II verbs, these verbs are also formed with a syllabic prefix, which is pronounced mita - ܡܝܬܰـ in the present and mta - ܡܬܰـ in the preterite: examples: ltm ܠܬܡ IIIp mitaltam – mtaltam ܡܝܬܰܠܬܰܡ - ܡܬܰܠܬܰܡ „to be collected“; dcr ܕܥܪ IIIp mitadcar – mtadcar ܡܝܬܰܕܥܰܪ – ܡܬܰܕܥܰܪ „to be brought back, to be sent back“; cmr ܥܡܪ IIIp mitacmar – mtacmar ܡܝܬܰܥܡܰܪ - ܡܬܰܥܡܰܪ „to be built“; fhm ܦܗܡ IIIp mitafham - mtafham ܡܝܬܰܦܗܰܡ - ܡܬܰܦܗܰܡ „to be explained, to be made understandable“. 1. Present inflection As in the other stems, the present base has two forms. With consonant-initial inflectional suffixes, the base is mitaltam - ܡܝܬܰܠܬܰܡـ and with vowel-initial inflectional suffixes, it is mitaltm - ܡܝܬܰܠܬܡـ . Here the present inflection of the example ltm ܠܬܡ IIIp mitaltam ܡܺܝܬܰܠܬܰܡ „to be collected“ is illustrated: Singular Plural 3. P. (m.) mitaltam ܡܺܝܬܰܠܬܰܡ mitaltmi ܡܺܝܬܰܠܬܡܺܝ 3. P. (f.) mitaltmo ܡܺܝܬܰܠܬܡܳܐ 2. P. mitaltmat ܡܺܝܬܰܠܬܡܰܬ mitaltmitu ܡܺܝܬܰܠܬܡܝܬܘ 1. P. (m.) mitaltamno ܡܺܝܬܰܠܬܰܡܢܳܐ mitaltmina ܡܺܝܬܰܠܬܡܝܢܰܐ 1. P. (f.) mitaltmono ܡܺܝܬܰܠܬܡܳܢܳܐ Note: Before vowel-initial inflectional suffixes (3.f.sg., 2.sg., 1.f.sg., 1./2./3. pl.) the consonant cluster at the end of the base - ltm - ـܠܬܡـ can be broken up to form - latm - ـܠܰܬܡـ or alternatively - l ё tm - ـܠܷܬܡـ . Example of the passive Stem III verbs in the present: Ak kṯowe kolozam mitasalmi lu mёlfono. The books must be delivered to the teacher. ܐܰܟ ܟܬ݂ܳܘܶܐ ܟܳܠܳܙܰܡ ܡܝܬܰܣܰܠܡܝ ܠܘ ܡܷܠܦܳܢܐ. U bayto gёd mitacmar xayifo inaqla d howe šaġole. The house will be built quickly when there are workers. ܐܘ ܒܰܝܬܐ ܓܷܕ ܡܝܬܰܥܡܰܪ ܟ݂ܰܝܝܦܐ ܐܝܢܰܩܠܰܐ ܕܗܳܘܶܐ ܫܰܓ݂ܳܠܶܐ. Az zuze lo komitaltmi mi šuqo. The money will not be gathered from the street. ܐܰܙ ܙܘܙܶܐ ܠܐ ܟܳܡܝܬܰܠܬܡܝ ܡܝ ܫܘܩܐ. 2. Preterite inflection In the preterite the bases mtaltam- ܡܬܰܠܬܰܡـ and mtaltm - ܡܬܰܠܬܡـ exist: Singular Plural 3. P. (m.) mtaltam ܡܬܰܠܬܰܡ mtaltm i ܡܬܰܠܬܡܺܝ 3. P. (f.) mtaltm o ܡܬܰܠܬܡܳܐ 2. P. mtaltm at ܡܬܰܠܬܡܰܬ݁ mtaltm itu ܡܬܰܠܬܡܺܝܬ݁ܽܘ 1. P. (m.) mtaltam no ܡܬܰܠܬܰܡܢܳܐ mtaltm ina ܡܬܰܠܬܡܺܝܢܰܐ 1. P. (f.) mtaltm ono ܡܬܰܠܬܡܳܢܳܐ Note: The same rule goes here: When preceding vowel-initial inflectional suffixes (3.f.sg., 2.sg., 1.f.sg., 1./2./3. pl.), the consonant clusters at the end of the base - ltm - ـܠܬܡـ can be split to form - latm - ـܠܰܬܡـ or alternatively - l ё tm - ـܠܷܬܡـ . Examples in the preterite of the passive Stem III verbs: Ar raḏoyoṯe gniwe mtasalmi lam more. The stolen cars were turned over to their owners. ܐܰܪ ܪܰܕ݂ܳܝܳܬ݂ܶܐ ܓܢܝܘܶܐ ܡܬܰܣܰܠܡܝ ܠܰܡ ܡܳܪܶܐ. An esore d bayn an aṯrawoṯayḏan mtaqaṭci. The relationships between our countries were severed. ܐܢ ܐܶܣܳܪܶܐ ܕܒܰܝܢ ܐܰܢ ܐܬ݂ܪܰܘܳܬ݂ܰܝܕ݂ܰܢ ܡܬܰܩܰܛܥܝ. Qay mtasṭar hul ucdo cal u camlo bišo? Why was the evil deed concealed until now? ܩܰܝ ܡܬܰܣܛܰܪ ܗܘܠ ܐܘܥܕܐ ܥܰܠ ܐܘ ܥܰܡܠܐ ܒܝܫܐ؟ Lo mtawlfitu mede doronoyo cal u kёnšo.

We consider primarily the consonants / ʾ / ( olaf ܐ ), /w/ ( waw ܘ ), /y/ ( yu ḏ ܝ ), as weak, which are to an extent no longer recognizable in Surayt. According to the position of the weak consonant in the root, three types of weak verbs can be distinguished: 1. verbs with a weak initial root consonant (radical), 2. verbs with a weak second radical, and 3. verbs with a weak third radical. There are also verbs which include two weak radicals in the root. Many of the most frequently occurring verbs in Surayt belong to this category. Verbs with / l- / ܠ‍ as a final consonant undergo minor changes upon taking the l -suffixes in the preterite, and therefore they are included in the irregular verb category. The inflection of the irregular verbs is only dealt with at level B of this course. An overview can already be found here in the section \"verb conjugation\" in the appendix. c) Modern constructions and borrowings of the verbs The necessity of procuring a place in Surayt for everyday language use, presses its speakers to the construction of neologisms. Indeed the formation of new verbs is not practiced everywhere in the same manner and can manifest in a variety of forms. 1. As a rule new verbs are formed according to the scheme of Stem II, as demonstrated in the aforementioned verbs mtalfan – mtalfanle ܡܬܰܠܦܰܢܠܶܗ – ܡܬܰܠܦܰܢ „to telephone“ and mparkar – mparkarle ܡܦ݁ܰܪܟܰܪ - ܡܦ݁ܰܪܟܰܪܠܶܗ „to park“. Further such verbs include m š amas – m š amasle ܡܫܰܡܰܣ - ܡܫܰܡܰܣܠܶܗ „to sunbathe“ mfakas – mfakasle ܡܦܰܟܰܤ - ܡܦܰܟܰܣܠܶܗ „to fax“ mvayaz – mvayazle ܡܒ݂ܰܝܰܙ - ܡܒ݂ܰܝܰܙܠܶܗ „to apply for a visa“ mdawa š – mdawa š le ܡܕܰܘܰܫ - ܡܕܰܘܰܫܠܶܗ „to shower“ msafar – msafarle ܡܣܰܦܰܪ - ܡܣܰܦܰܪܠܶܗ „to travel“ 2. A second much more common method of verb formation presents itself as the composite of the helping verb soyam – s ё mle ܣܳܝܰܡ - ܣܷܡܠܶܗ „to make, to do“ together with the foreign noun or the infinitive: kosoyam talafon he telephones ܟܳܣܳܝܰܡ ܬܰܠܰܦܳܢ s ё mle i raḏayto park he parked the car ܣܷܡܠܶܗ ܐܺܝ ܪܰܕ݂ܰܝܬܐ ܦ݁ܰܪܟ g ё d saymono i egar ṯ o faks I will fax the letter ܓܷܕ ܣܰܝܡܳܢܐ ܐܝ ܐܶܓܰܪܬ݂ܐ ܦܰܟܤ sumu du š meq ё m d n ё fqitu Shower before you (pl.) go out! ܣܘܡܘ ܕܘܫ ܡܶܩܷܡ ܕܢܷܦܩܝܬܘ d) The Imperative 1. The imperative of regular verbs The imperative has one respective form for singular and plural. Whereas the singular form is used with no suffix, the plural form is distinguished by way of a –u ‍ ـܘ at the end. Regular verbs have the following imperative forms: Stem I Stem II Stem III Sg. gra š! pull! ܓܪܰܫ mzaban! sell! ܡܙܰܒܰܢ breakfast! frühstücke! ܡܰܩܪܰܛ Pl. gra š u! pull! ܓܪܰܫܘ mzabenu! sell! ܡܙܰܒܶܢܘ breakfast! frühstückt! ܡܰܩܪܶܛܘ 2. Negation of the imperative The imperative is negated with the help of lo + base form of the present in the second person (sg. and pl. respectively): Imperative Imperative negated ṭcay! ܛܥܰܝ forget! but: lo ṭocat! ܠܐ ܛܳܥܰܬ don’t forget! ṭcayu! ܛܥܰܝܘ forget! lo ṭocitu ܠܐ ܛܳܥܝܬܘ don’t forget! dmax! ܕܡܰܟ݂ sleep! but: lo d ё mxat! ܠܐ ܕܷܡܟ݂ܰܬ don’t sleep! dmaxu! ܕܡܰܟ݂ܘ sleep! lo d ё mxitu! ܠܐ ܕܷܡܟ݂ܝܬܘ don’t sleep! m ё ḥzan! ܡܷܚܙܰܢ be sad! but: lo mëḥzonat! ܠܐ ܡܷܚܙܳܢܰܬ don’t be sad! m ё ḥz e nu! ܡܷܚܙܶܢܘ be sad! lo m ё ḥzonitu! ܠܐ ܡܷܚܙܳܢܝܬܘ don’t be sad! e) Object marking in the present I In the present the object is expressed through an object particle that follows the verb, which can however also be attached to the verb as a suffix. As an independent particle, the object has the following forms: Singular Plural 3. P. (m.) le ܠܶܗ alle ܐܠܠܶܗ 3. P. (f.) la ܠܰܗ 2. P. (m.) lux ܠܘܟ݂ lxu ܠܟ݂ܘ 2. P. (f.) lax ܠܰܟ݂ 1. P. li ܠܝ lan ܠܰܢ Much more frequent is the attachment of the object to the verb form as a suffix. This can change both the verb form and the object marker. For clarification here the suffixes of present form, 1. f. / m. in the singular: 1. f.Sg. kor ё ḥmono ܟܳܪܷܚܡܳܢܐ + le ܠܶܗ korёḥmalle ܟܳܪܷܚܡܰܠܠܶܗ I love him + la ܠܰܗ korёḥmalla ܟܳܪܷܚܡܰܠܠܰܗ I love her + lux ܠܘܟ݂ korёḥmallux ܟܳܪܷܚܡܰܠܠܘܟ݂ I love you (m.sg.) + lax ܠܰܟ݂ korёḥmallax ܟܳܪܷܚܡܰܠܠܰܟ݂ I love you (f.sg.) + alle ܐܰܠܠܶܗ korёḥmanne ܟܳܪܷܚܡܰܢܢܶܗ I love them + lxu ܠܟ݂ܘ korёḥmanxu ܟܳܪܷܚܡܰܢܟ݂ܘ I love you (pl.) k ё bcono ܟܷܐܒܥܳܢܐ + li ܠܝ kёbcalli ܟܷܐܒܥܰܠܠܝ I would like (for me) + lan ܠܰܢ kёbcallan ܟܷܐܒܥܰܠܠܰܢ I would like (for) us 1.m.Sg. koroḥamno ܟܳܪܳܚܰܡܢܐ + le ܠܶܗ koroḥamne ܟܳܪܳܚܰܡܢܶܗ I love him + la ܠܰܗ koroḥamna ܟܳܪܳܚܰܡܢܰܗ I love her + lux ܠܘܟ݂ koroḥamnux ܟܳܪܳܚܰܡܢܘܟ݂ I love you (m.sg.) + lax ܠܰܟ݂ koroḥamnax ܟܳܪܳܚܰܡܢܰܟ݂ I love you (f.sg.) + alle ܐܰܠܠܶܗ koroḥamnanne ܟܳܪܳܚܰܡܢܰܢܢܶܗ I love them + lxu ܠܟ݂ܘ koroḥamnanxu ܟܳܪܳܚܰܡܢܰܢܟ݂ܘ I love you (pl.) kobacno ܟܳܐܒܰܥܢܐ + li ܠܝ kobacni ܟܳܐܒܰܥܢܝ I would like (for me) + lan ܠܰܢ kobacnan ܟܳܐܒܰܥܢܰܢ I would like (for) us A detailed discussion of the object marking of the verb follows in Level B of this course.", "Singular", "Plural"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["Singular", "Plural"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["3.

During the summer season, visitors enjoy the many local fruits and vegetables such as grapes, pomegranates, figs, peaches, fresh almonds and much more; all available for them to pick in the fields themselves. In the past, Turabdin was also known for its wine production, a tradition that dates back at least 3000 years. Syriacs who returned to Turabdin have revived this wine tradition and market their wine under the label Süryani Şarabı in Turkish. This wine has become very popular and is also exported to Europe. While the generations born in Turabdin like to visit their native village or town and refresh their childhood memories, the generations born in the diaspora can connect with their historical cultural heritage for the first time. Among the most visited sights are the Zaafaran Monastery near Mardin, the Mor Gabriel Monastery near Midyat, the Virgin Mary Church in Ḥaḥ and more recently, the Mor Augin Monastery on Mount Izlo near the town of Nusaybin ( Nṣiwën ܢܨܝܘܷܢ ).", "In the winter, you can chat or listen to stories indoors by the fireplace while enjoying snacks prepared in the summer season and stored for the winter, such as bastiq ܒܰܣܬܝܩ , coliqe ܥܳܠܝܩܶܐ and ḥalile ܚܰܠܝܠܶܐ (see chapter 12, Culture).

They express a time with reference to the moment of speaking: adyawma today ܐܰܕܝܰܘܡܰܐ adṣafro this morning ܐܰܕܨܰܦܪܐ adfalge d yawmo this afternoon ܐܰܕܦܰܠܓܶܗ ܕܝܰܘܡܐ adcaṣriye this evening, tonight ܐܰܕܥܰܨܪܝـܝܶܐ adlalyo tonight ܐܰܕܠܰܠܝܐ adšato this year ܐܰܕܫܰܬܐ The adverb annaqla ܐܰܢܢܰܩܠܰܐ „now“ with word initial stress also belongs to this group. The following adverbials of time and frequency have the plural ending -awo ṯe : ṣafrawoṯe in the morning, mornings ܨܰܦܪܰܘܳܬ݂ܶܐ caṣriyawoṯe in the evening, evenings ܥܰܨܪܝـܝܰܘܳܬ݂ܶܐ lalyawoṯe in the night, nights ܠܰܠܝܰܘܳܬ݂ܶܐ naqlawoṯe sometimes ܢܰܩܠܰܘܳܬ݂ܶܐ 2. Adverbs of place Adverbs of place are as follows: harke here ܗܰܪܟܶܐ tamo there ܬܰܡܐ laltaḥ down here/there, downstairs, below ܠܰܠܬܰܚ lalcal up here/there, upstairs, above ܠܰܠܥܰܠ lugab alongside, next to here/there ܠܘܓܰܒ lawġël inside ܠܰܘܓ݂ܷܠ larwal outside ܠܰܪܘܰܠ 3. Other adverbs There are other adverbs apart from the temporal and locative adverbials mentioned above, for example the following adverbs of manner, condition and degree: šafiro beautifully ܫܰܦܝܪܐ ṭawwo well ܛܰܘܘܐ hawxa so, like that ܗܰܘܟ݂ܰܐ mawxa therefore, thus ܡܰܘܟ݂ܰܐ gušt almost ܓܘܫܬ disa again ܕܝܣܰܐ naqla ḥreto again, once more, another time ܢܰܩܠܰܐ ܚܪܶܬܐ bëlḥuḏe only ܒܷܠܚܘܕ݂ܶܗ cam ḥḏoḏe together ܥܰܡ ܚܕ݂ܳܕ݂ܶܐ 4. Examples of the use of the adverbs Kobac fayšat adlalyo harke d ḥozina ramḥël mën kiban saymina lux. (L.14) You (sg.) have to stay here tonight , tomorrow we will see what we can do for you (m. sg.). ܟܳܐܒܰܥ ܦܰܝܫܰܬ ܐܰܕܠܰܠܝܐ ܗܰܪܟܶܐ ܕܚܳܙܝܢܐ ܪܰܡܚܷܠ ܡܷܢ ܟܝܒܰܢ ܣܰܝܡܝܢܰܐ ܠܘܟ݂.

The noun without an article is indefinite, f. ex. k ṯowo ܟܬ݂ܳܘܐ „“(a) book“ as opposed to u k ṯowo ܐܘ ܟܬ݂ܳܘܐ „the book“. The indefiniteness can be marked additionally by the number “one” m. ḥa ܚܰܐ , f. ḥḏo ܚܕ݂ܐ . u kṯowo the book ܐܘ ܟܬ݂ܳܘܐ kṯowo ~ ḥa kṯowo a book ܚܰܐ ܟܬ݂ܳܘܐ ~ ܟܬ݂ܳܘܐ i raḏayto the car ܐܝ ܪܰܕ݂ܰܝܬܐ raḏayto ~ ḥḏo raḏayto a car ܪܰܕ݂ܰܝܬܐ ~ ܚܕ݂ܐ ܪܰܕ݂ܰܝܬܐ ab bote the houses ܐܰܒ ܒܳܬܶܐ bote houses ܒܳܬܶܐ Examples: Këtle yolufe Holandoye He’s got Dutch students. ܟܷܬܠܶܗ ܝܳܠܘܦܶܐ ܗܳܠܰܢܕܳܝܶܐ Aš šurone këtte aḏne The walls have ears. ܐܰܫ ܫܘܪܳܢܶܐ ܟܷܬܬܶܗ ܐܰܕ݂ܢܶܐ Bu banyo kit duš There’s a shower in the bathroom. ܒܘ ܒܰܐܢܝܐ ܟܝܬ ܕܘܫ", "Present base", "Preterite"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["Present base", "Preterite"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["Sg.", "3. m.", "obac"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["3. f.", "ёbc o", "ܐܷܒܥܐ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["2. m.", "ёbc at", "ܐܷܒܥܰܬ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["2. f.", "ёbc at", "ܐܷܒܥܰܬ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["1. m.", "obac no", "ܐܳܒܰܥܢܐ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["1. f.", "ёbc ono", "ܐܷܒܥܳܢܐ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["Pl.", "3.", "ёbc i"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["2.", "ёbc it u", "ܐܷܒܥܝܬܘ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["1.", "ёbc ina", "ܐܷܒܥܝܢܰܐ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["Sg.", "3. m.", "oḏac"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["3. f.", "ёḏc o", "ܐܷܕ݂ܥܐ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["2. m.", "ёḏc at", "ܐܷܕ݂ܥܰܬ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["2. f.", "ёḏc at", "ܐܷܕ݂ܥܰܬ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["1. m.", "oḏac no", "ܐܳܕ݂ܰܥܢܐ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["1. f.", "ёḏc ono", "ܐܷܕ݂ܥܳܢܐ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["Pl.", "3.", "ёḏc i"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["2.", "ёḏc it u", "ܐܷܕ݂ܥܝܬܘ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["1.", "ёḏc ina", "ܐܷܕ݂ܥܝܢܰܐ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["Sg.", "3. m.", "yonaq"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["3. f.", "yënq o", "ܝܷܢܩܐ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["2. m.", "yënq at", "ܝܷܢܩܰܬ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["2. f.", "yënq at", "ܝܷܢܩܰܬ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["1. m.", "yonaq no", "ܝܳܢܰܩܢܐ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["1. f.", "yënq ono", "ܝܷܢܩܳܢܐ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["Pl.", "3.", "yënq i"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["2.", "yënq it u", "ܝܷܢܩܝܬܘ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["1.", "yënq ina", "ܝܷܢܩܝܢܰܐ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["ucdo", "now", "ܐܘܥܕܐ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["meqëm", "before", "ܡܶܩܷܡ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["bëṯër", "after(wards)", "ܒܷܬ݂ܷܪ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["aṯmël", "yesterday", "ܐܰܬ݂ܡܷܠ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["ramḥël", "tomorrow", "ܪܰܡܚܷܠ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["ëšqaḏ", "last year", "ܐܷܫܩܰܕ݂"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["heš", "still, yet", "ܗܶܫ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["ḥeloyo", "early (in the day)", "ܚܶܠܳܝܐ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["xayifo", "quickly, early", "ܟ݂ܰܝـܝܦܐ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["mwaxro", "late", "ܡܘܰܟ݂ܪܐ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["adyawma", "today", "ܐܰܕܝܰܘܡܰܐ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["adṣafro", "this morning", "ܐܰܕܨܰܦܪܐ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["adfalge d yawmo", "this afternoon", "ܐܰܕܦܰܠܓܶܗ ܕܝܰܘܡܐ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["adcaṣriye", "this evening, tonight", "ܐܰܕܥܰܨܪܝـܝܶܐ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["adlalyo", "tonight", "ܐܰܕܠܰܠܝܐ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["adšato", "this year", "ܐܰܕܫܰܬܐ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["ṣafrawoṯe", "in the morning, mornings", "ܨܰܦܪܰܘܳܬ݂ܶܐ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["caṣriyawoṯe", "in the evening, evenings", "ܥܰܨܪܝـܝܰܘܳܬ݂ܶܐ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["lalyawoṯe", "in the night, nights", "ܠܰܠܝܰܘܳܬ݂ܶܐ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["naqlawoṯe", "sometimes", "ܢܰܩܠܰܘܳܬ݂ܶܐ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["harke", "here", "ܗܰܪܟܶܐ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["tamo", "there", "ܬܰܡܐ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["laltaḥ", "down here/there, downstairs, below", "ܠܰܠܬܰܚ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["lalcal", "up here/there, upstairs, above", "ܠܰܠܥܰܠ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["lugab", "alongside, next to here/there", "ܠܘܓܰܒ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["lawġël", "inside", "ܠܰܘܓ݂ܷܠ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["larwal", "outside", "ܠܰܪܘܰܠ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["šafiro", "beautifully", "ܫܰܦܝܪܐ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["ṭawwo", "well", "ܛܰܘܘܐ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["hawxa", "so, like that", "ܗܰܘܟ݂ܰܐ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["mawxa", "therefore, thus", "ܡܰܘܟ݂ܰܐ"]}]}, {"id": "2.2.4", "title": "Exercises II", "blocks": [{"type": "table_row", "cells": ["yawme dë tre", "yawme dë tloṯo", "yawme d arbco"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["ܝܰܘܡܶܗ ܕܷܬܪܶܐ", "ܝܰܘܡܶܗ ܕܷܬܠܳܬ݂ܐ", "ܝܰܘܡܶܗ ܕܐܰܪܒܥܐ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["------", "------", "------"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["1. maṭro -

People try to learn from which village in Turabdin they are. Traditionally, people in the villages had close and often family relationships with each other. These relationships continue to be maintained in the West through registered village associations. Almost each village in Turabdin has a village association. These village associations serve to strengthen the identity and a sense of belonging in the diaspora, while providing support to the development of the villages in Turabdin. The family roots connected with a village or town in Turabdin and identification with these places have established the social organisation of Syriacs. The question about one’s historical origin also serves to develop social networks and to express a longing for one's historical home or place of birth. The well-known song Mayko aṯat ܡܰܝܟܐ ܐܰܬ݂ܰܬ „Where are you from?“ written by Marawge Aydin and sung by Indravus Bagandi (1999) illustrates well how this question is used among Syriacs: Mayko aṯat ܡܰܝܟܐ ܐܰܬ݂ܰܬ Dcarto: Mayko aṯat, mayko aṯat?

This /l/ ܠ‍ is absorbed by the / l / ܠ‍ of the inflectional suffixes in the preterite and consequently the verb has a different base, for example: šql ܫܩܠ I: šoqal – šqi le ܫܳܩܰܠ – ܫܩܝܠܶܗ „to take; to buy“ compare strong verb: grš ܓܪܫ I: goraš – gr ёšle ܓܳܪܰܫ - ܓܪܷܫܠܶܗ „to pull“ qtl ܩܬܠ II: mqatal – mqat ele ܡܩܰܬܰܠ - ܡܩܰܬܶܠܶܗ „to fight“ compare strong verb: zbn II: mzaban – mzab anle ܡܙܰܒܰܢ - ܡܙܰܒܰܢܠܶܗ „to sell“ šql ܫܩܠ III: mašqal – mašq ele ܡܰܫܩܰܠ - ܡܰܫܩܶܠܶܗ „to let sb. buy“ compare strong verb: grš ܓܪܫ III : magraš – magr ašle ܡܰܓܪܰܫ - ܡܰܓܪܰܫܠܶܗ „to let sb. pull“ Below you find an illustration of the inflection of stem I by comparing šqile ܫܩܝܠܶܗ „he bought“ to grёšle ܓܪܷܫܠܶܗ „he pulled“: šql – Preterite ܫܩܠ grš – Preterite ܓܪܫ Sg. 3. m. šqi le ܫܩܝܠܶܗ grёš le ܓܪܷܫܠܶܗ 3. f. šqi la ܫܩܝܠܰܗ grёš la ܓܪܷܫܠܰܗ 2. m. šqi lux ܫܩܝܠܘܟ݂ grёš lux ܓܪܷܫܠܘܟ݂ 2. f. šqi lax ܫܩܝܠܰܟܼ grёš lax ܓܪܷܫܠܰܟ݂ 1. c. šqi li ܫܩܝܠܝ grёš li ܓܪܷܫܠܝ Pl. 3. šqël le ܫܩܷܠܠܶܗ grёš še ܓܪܷܫܫܶܗ 2. šqël xu ܫܩܷܠܟ݂ܘ grёš xu ܓܪܷܫܟ݂ܘ 1. šqi lan ܫܩܝܠܰܢ grёš lan ܓܪܷܫܠܰܢ Since the inflectional endings of the 2pl. and 3pl. do not start with l- ܠ‍ , these forms remain unaffected. The present forms and (medio)passive stem formations of these verbs behave like strong verbs. The / l / ܠ‍ of the root disappears in stems II and III when adding the L­suffxes and the vowel of the base is / e / instead of / a /: qtl ܩܬܠ II: mqat a l + le = mqat e le „he fought“ ܡܩܰܬܰܠ + ܠܶܗ = ܡܩܰܬܶܠܶܗ šql ܫܩܠ III: mašq a l + le = mašq e le „he let sb. buy“ ܡܰܫܩܰܠ + ܠܶܗ = ܡܰܫܩܶܠܶܗ qtl II – Preterite ܩܬܠ šql III – Preterite ܫܩܠ Sg. 3. m. mqate le ܡܩܰܬܶܠܶܗ mašqe le ܡܰܫܩܶܠܶܗ 3. f. mqate la ܡܩܰܬܶܠܰܗ mašqe la ܡܰܫܩܶܠܰܗ 2. m. mqate lux ܡܩܰܬܶܠܘܟ݂ mašqe lux ܡܰܫܩܶܠܘܟ݂ 2. f. mqate lax ܡܩܰܬܶܠܰܟ݂ mašqe lax ܡܰܫܩܶܠܰܟ݂ 1. c. mqate li ܡܩܰܬܶܠܝ mašqe li ܡܰܫܩܶܠܝ Pl. 3. mqata lle ܡܩܰܬܰܠܠܶܗ mašqa lle ܡܰܫܩܰܠܠܶܗ 2. mqata lxu ܡܩܰܬܰܠܟ݂ܘ mašqa lxu ܡܰܫܩܰܠܟ݂ܘ 1. mqate lan ܡܩܰܬܶܠܰܢ mašqe lan ܡܰܫܩܶܠܰܢ The imperative is like that of strong verbs: šql ܫܩܠ I: Sg. šqal! ܫܩܰܠ „buy (sg.)!” Pl. šqalu! ܫܩܰܠܘ „buy (pl.)!“ qtl ܩܬܠ II: Sg. mqatal! ܡܩܰܬܰܠ „fight (sg.)!“ Pl. mqatelu! ܡܩܰܬܶܠܘ „fight (pl.)!“ šql ܫܩܠ III: Sg. mašqal! ܡܰܫܩܰܠ „let sb. buy (sg.)!“ Pl. mašqelu! ܡܰܫܩܶܠܘ „let sb. buy (pl.)!“ c) Expressing modality To express modality Surayt uses invariant and impersonal modal markers and modal verbs combined with a lexical verb. The lexical verb that immediately follows is inflected with or without the preverb / d / ܕ as the subjunctive, i.e. the unmarked base of the present: 1. “need, must, should” The invariant forms këbce ܟܷܒܥܶܐ and kobac ܟܳܐܒܰܥ are used to express “need”, “must” and “should”. Examples: Mëftakarla d këbce saymo mede. (L. 20) She thought she must do something. ܡܷܦܬܰܟܰܪܠܰܗ ܕܟܷܒܥܶܐ ܣܰܝܡܐ ܡܶܕܶܐ. Kobac fayšat adlalyo harke. (L.14) You (sg.) need to stay here tonight. ܟܳܐܒܰܥ ܦܰܝܫܰܬ ܐܰܕܠܰܠܝܐ ܗܰܪܟܶܐ. Conveying the same sense, lazëm ܠܰܙܷܡ or kolozam ܟܳܠܳܙܰܡ and majbur ܡܰܔܒܘܪ can occur in the same position: Lazëm makaṯwo ruḥa bu beṯṣawbo. She should register at the university. ܠܰܙܷܡ ܡܰܟܰܬ݂ܘܐ ܪܘܚܰܗ ܒܘ ܒܶܝܬ݂ܨܰܘܒܐ. Kolozam d soyamno ah hërgayḏi. I (m.) need to do my homework. ܟܳܠܳܙܰܡ ܕܣܳܝܰܡܢܐ ܐܰܗ ܗܷܪܓܰܝܕ݂ܝ. Majbur ëzzino li madrašto. I have to go to school. ܡܰܔܒܘܪ ܐܷܙܙܝܢܐ ܠܝ ܡܰܕܪܰܫܬܐ. The modals lazëm ܠܰܙܷܡ and majbur ܡܰܔܒܘܪ can be enhanced with the 3sg. copula: Lazëm yo d ëzzux lu bayto. You (m. sg.) need to go home. ܠܰܙܷܡ ܝܐ ܕܐܷܙܙܘܟ݂ ܠܘ ܒܰܝܬܐ. Majbur yo d zawnina jule ḥaṯe lu ḥago. We need to buy new clothes for the party. ܡܰܔܒܘܪ ܝܐ ܕܙܰܘܢܝܢܰܐ ܔܘܠܶܐ ܚܰܬ݂ܶܐ ܠܘ ܚܰܓܐ. The past copula shifts the event to the past tense: Majbur wa d nëfqina mu bayto. We had to leave the house. ܡܰܔܒܘܪ ܘܰܐ ܕܢܷܦܩܝܢܰܐ ܡܘ ܒܰܝܬܐ. Lazëm wa d saymat u buḥrono. You (sg.) had to make the exam. ܠܰܙܷܡ ܘܰܐ ܕܣܰܝܡܰܬ ܐܘ ܒܘܚܪܳܢܐ. The modal verb kolozam ܟܳܠܳܙܰܡ corresponds with the 3msg. of the lexical verb lozam - lazëm ܠܳܙܰܡ - ܠܰܙܷܡ “to need, to be necessary”, so that its past tense form is expressed by the imperfect 3msg. lozamwa ܠܳܙܰܡܘܰܐ : Lozamwa d zawnina jule ḥaṯe lu ḥago. We needed to buy new clothes for the party. ܠܳܙܰܡܘܰܐ ܕܙܰܘܢܝܢܰܐ ܔܘܠܶܐ ܚܰܬ݂ܶܐ ܠܘ ܚܰܓܐ. 2. “can, could, may, might” Surayt does not distinguish between “can, could, to be able” and “may, might”. Both are expressed by kib- ܟܝܒ‍ـ inflected for personal endings. The endings suffixed to kib- ܟܝܒ‍ـ correspond with the inflection of the preposition b- (G11.b). The base kib- ܟܝܒ‍ـ shifts to këp- ܟܷܦ݁‍ـ in the 2pl and 3pl. The negative counterpart of kib- ܟܝܒ‍ـ is layb- ܠܰܝܒ‍ـ and its inflection parallels kib- ܟܝܒ‍ـ . The base layb- ܠܰܝܒ‍ـ shifts to lap- ܠܰܦ݁‍ـ in the 2pl. and 3pl. kib- ܟܝܒ‍ـ „to be able“ and layb- ܠܰܝܒ‍ـ „to be unable“ in the present can, could cannot, could not Sg. 3. m. kib e ܟܝܒܶܗ layb e ܠܰܝܒܶܗ 3. f. kib a ܟܝܒܰܗ layb a ܠܰܝܒܰܗ 2. m. kib ux ܟܝܒܘܟ݂ layb ux ܠܰܝܒܘܟ݂ 2. f. kib ax ܟܝܒܰܟ݂ layb ax ܠܰܝܒܰܟ݂ 1. c. kib i ܟܝܒܝ layb i ܠܰܝܒܝ Pl. 3. këp pe ܟܷܦ݁ܦ݁ܶܗ lap pe ܠܰܦ݁ܦ݁ܶܗ 2. këp xu ܟܷܦ݁ܟ݂ܘ lap xu ܠܰܦ݁ܟ݂ܘ 1. kib an ܟܝܒܰܢ lay ban ܠܰܝܒܰܢ The bases këp- ܟܷܦ݁‍ـ for “can, to be able” and lap - ܠܰܦ݁‍ـ “cannot, to be unable” are followed by -way- ܘܰܝ‍ـ (2 pl. and 3pl. –wa- ܘܰ , cf.

(L.16) When can we do our wedding? ܐܶܡܰܐ ܟܝܒܰܢ ܣܰܝܡܝܢܰܐ ܐܝ ܡܷܫܬܘܬ݂ܰܝܕ݂ܰܢ؟ Notes: kib- ܟܝܒ‍ـ and layb- ܠܰܝܒ‍ـ also have the lexical meaning of “to have inside, to contain, to consist of; there is/are in; to be approximately” and their corresponding negatives. Examples: I qriṯo layba noše. There are no people in the village. ܐܝ ܩܪܝܬ݂ܐ ܠܰܝܒܰܗ ܢܳܫܶܐ. I šato kiba tracsar yarḥe. (L.9) A year consists of twelve months. ܐܝ ܫܰܬܐ ܟܝܒܰܗ ܬܪܰܥܣܰܪ ܝܰܪܚܶܐ. Kibe šato d azzino l Ṭurcabdin. It’s been approximately a year since I went to Turabdin. ܟܝܒܶܗ ܫܰܬܐ ܕܐܰܙܙܝܢܐ ܠܛܘܪܥܰܒܕܝܢ. 2. kib- ܟܝܒ‍ـ as modal can also be replaced by the verb qodar – qadër ܩܳܕܰܪ – ܩܰܕܷܪ (< qdr ܩܕܪ I) with the same function. Lo qad ër oṯe sidan. He was unable to come to us. ܠܐ ܩܰܕܷܪ ܐܳܬ݂ܶܐ ܣܝܕܰܢ. Gëd qudritu zawnitu bayto? Will you (pl.) be able to buy a house? ܓܷܕ ܩܘܕܪܝܬܘ ܙܰܘܢܝܬܘ ܒܰܝܬܐ؟ Qay i Marta lo qadiro huyo taxtore?

Direct object in the preterite (3.m.Sg., 3.f.Sg. und 3.Pl.) In the preterite ( grëšle ܓܪܷܫܠܶܗ , grëšla ܓܪܷܫܠܰܗ , etc., see G8.a) the direct object of the 3 rd m . sg., 3 rd f . sg. and 3 rd pl. is integrated in the verbal inflection. Accordingly, there are three bases inflected for the direct object to which the L-suffixes – le ‍ ܠܶܗ , - lux ‍ ܠܘܟ݂ , etc. are added. These bases are : 3.m.Sg. grëš- ܓܪܷܫـ : gr ë š- le ܓܪܷܫܠܶܗ „ he pulled him “ 3.f.Sg. griš o - ܓܪܝܫܳـ : grišo- le ܓܪܝܫܳܠܶܗ „he pulled her “ 3.Pl. griš i- ܓܪܝܫܝـ : griši- le ܓܪܝܫܝܠܶܗ „he pulled them “ The 3 rd m. sg. base with L-suffixes is also the default form of the preterite when the object is not expressed on the verb. Thus grëš le ܓܪܷܫܠܶܗ can mean either “he pulled” or “he pulled him ”. The 2 nd pl. and 3 rd pl. L-suffixes added to the bases grišo - ܓܪܝܫܳـ and griši- ܓܪܝܫܝـ are distinct from those added to the default base grëš- ܓܪܷܫـ ( -xu ‍ ܟ݂ܘ and –Ce ـܶ , see G8.a). They are –lxu ‍ ܠܟ݂ܘ , -lle ‍ ܠܠܶܗ when added to grišo- ܓܪܝܫܳـ and persectively –nxu ‍ ܢܟ݂ܘ , -nne ‍ ܢܢܶܗ when added to griši- ܓܪܝܫܝـ . The final vowels of the bases are –a ܰ instead of –o ܳ and -ë ܷ instead of –i ‍ ـܝـ before these L-suffixes: griš o -+ -lxu = griš a lxu ܓܪܝܫܳـ + ‍ܠܟ݂ܘ = ܓܪܝܫܰܠܟ݂ܘ „you (pl.) pulled her “ griš o + -lle =griš alle ܓܪܝܫܳـ + ‍ܠܠܶܗ = ܓܪܝܫܰܠܠܶܗ „they pulled her “ griš i + -nxu ܓܪܝܫܝ‍ـ + ـܢܟ݂ܘ zu grišënxu ܓܪܝܫܷܢܟ݂ܘ „you (pl.) pulled them “ griš i + -nne ܓܪܝܫܝ‍ـ + ـܢܢܶܗ zu grišënne ܓܪܝܫܷܢܢܶܗ „they pulled them “ Such forms with internal object marking are typically used to refer back to something or someone in the immediate context. Examples: Këtwa cal i ṭëbliṯo egarṯo, midole w q ëryole . There was a letter on the table, he took it (f.) and read it (f.). ܟܷܬܘܰܐ ܥܰܠ ‌ܐܝ ܛܷܒܠܝܬ݂ܐ ܐܶܓܰܪܬ݂ܐ، ܡܝܕܳܠܶܗ ܘܩܷܪܝܳܠܶܗ.

Expressing the direct object of other persons in the preterite The direct object is expressed for other persons by adding the L-suffixes to the conjugated preterite forms.

Examples: grëšlele zuze mu otomat He withdrew himself some money from the ATM. ܓܪܷܫܠܶܠܶܗ ܙܘܙܶܐ ܡܘ ܐܳܬܳܡܰܐܬ zwënlala fësṭan li mëštuṯo di ḥwarṯayḏa She bought herself a dress for the wedding of her friend (f.). ܙܘܷܢܠܰܠܰܗ ܦܷܣܛܰܐܢ ܠܝ ܡܷܫܬܘܬ݂ܐ ܕܝ ܚܘܰܪܬ݂ܰܝܕ݂ܰܗ macmarranne bayto bi qriṯo They built themselves a house in the village. ܡܰܥܡܰܪܪܰܢܢܶܗ ܒܰܝܬܐ ܒܝ ܩܪܝܬ݂ܐ The preposition l- ܠ‍ “for, to” with pronominal suffixes (G.11b) can mark the indirect object independently of the inflected verb: gr ëš luxli ܓܪܷܫܠܘܟ݂ܠܝ = grëšlux eli ܓܪܷܫܠܘܟ݂ ܐܶܠܝ „you (msg.) pulled for me“ maḥwelalle u plan ܡܰܚܘܶܠܰܠܠܶܗ ܐܘ ܦ݁ܠܰܐܢ = maḥwele u plan alle ܡܰܚܘܶܠܶܗ ܐܘ ܦ݁ܠܰܐܢ ܐܰܠܠܶܗ „he showed the plan to them“ hiye mërleli ܗܝـܝܶܐ ܡܷܪܠܶܠܝ = hiye m ërle eli ܗܝـܝܶܐ ܡܷܪܠܶܗ ܐܶܠܝ „he told me“ b) Note on word stress The addition of object suffixes does not affect the inflected base, i.e. only the next to last syllabe of the base is stressed, so that the general rule of penultimate stress (L 24.4) does not apply in this case.

Special features of the verb ʾmr ܐܡܪ I „to say, to tell“ with L-suffixes The highly frequent verb ʾmr ܐܡܪ I “to say, to tell” undergoes more changes when object suffixes are added. These go back to the assimilation of the /m/ to the /r/ in the combinations /mr ܡܪ / and /rl ܪܠ‍ /. Below you find an overview: Present → 3.m.Sg. 3.f.Sg. 2.Sg. 1.m.Sg.

Indirect object marking by means of the preposition l- ܠ‍ـ „for, to“ Finally, like the preterite (G.21a.3), the indirect object can be expressed by the independent pronouns based on the preposition l- ܠ‍ـ (G.11b): Kokoṯaw ele egarṯo. He is writing him a letter. ܟܳܟܳܬ݂ܰܘ ܐܶܠܶܗ ܐܶܓܰܪܬ݂ܐ. Kolozam mšadritu alle zuze. You should send them money. ܟܳܠܳܙܰܡ ܡܫܰܕܪܝܬܘ ܐܰܠܠܶܗ ܙܘܙܶܐ. Gëd kurxina alxu cal raḏayto ḥreto. We are looking for a different car for you (pl.). ܓܷܕ ܟܘܪܟ݂ܝܢܰܐ ܐܰܠܟ݂ܘ ܥܰܠ ܪܰܕ݂ܰܝܬܐ ܚܪܶܬܐ. b) Conditional clauses Conditional clauses are subordinate clauses introduced by the following conjunctions all conveying the sense of “if, supposing, in case, on condition that” d ܕ , häka ܗܱܟܰܐ , iḏa ܐܝܕ݂ܰܐ , iḏa d ܐܝܕ݂ܰܐ ܕ , inaqla d ܐܝܢܰܩܠܰܐ ܕ , gud ܓܘܕ , ënkan (d) ( ܕ ) ܐܷܢܟܰܐܢ , and en d ܐܶܢ ܕ . The subordinate clause usually precedes the main clause with which it belongs. There are realis and irrealis types of conditional clauses in Surayt. 1. Realis conditional clauses In realis conditional clauses the verb of the main clause is always in the future tense, while the verb in the subordinate clause is either in the subjunctive (i.e. the present form without preverbal modifier) or in the preterite. Examples: Iḏa ucdo ṭacina mede, bëṯër gëd oṯe l bolan. In case we’ve forgotten something now, it’ll come to mind later. ܐܝܕ݂ܰܐ ܐܘܥܕܐ ܛܰܥܝܢܰܐ ܡܶܕܶܐ، ܒܷܬ݂ܷܪ ܓܷܕ ܐܳܬ݂ܶܐ ܠܒܳܠܰܢ. Häka mucdo l šabṯo lo nayëḥlux, g ëd mitawblat lu taxtor. In case you (msg.) haven’t recovered by a week from now, you’ll (msg.) be taken to the doctor. ܗܱܟܰܐ ܡܐܘܥܕܐ ܠܫܰܒܬ݂ܐ ܠܐ ܢܰܝܷܚܠܘܟ݂، ܓܷܕ ܡܝܬܰܘܒܠܰܬ ܠܘ ܬܰܟܬܳܪ. D lo howalxu šwole ḥrene, gëd cëbrina šotina qaḥwa. If you (pl.) don’t have any further questions, we shall go inside and drink coffee. ܕܠܐ ܗܳܘܰܠܟ݂ܘ ܫܘܳܠܶܐ ܚܪܶܢܶܐ، ܓܷܕ ܥܷܒܪܝܢܰܐ ܫܳܬܝܢܰܐ ܩܰܚܘܰܐ. D howeli zabno, g ëd koṯawno kṯowo. If I have time, I (m.) will write a book. ܕܗܳܘܶܠܝ ܙܰܒܢܐ، ܓܷܕ ܟܳܬ݂ܰܘܢܐ ܟܬ݂ܳܘܐ. Iḏa u Afrem latle wacde aw mede lë syomo, gëd oṯina . If Afrem doesn’t have any appointments or something else to do, we shall come . ܐܝܕ݂ܰܐ ܐܘ ܐܰܦܪܶܡ ܠܰܬܠܶܗ ܘܰܥܕܶܐ ܐܰܘ ܡܶܕܶܐ ܠܷܣܝܳܡܐ، ܓܷܕ ܐܳܬ݂ܝܢܰܐ. The subordinate clause follows the main clause in the following sentence: Gëd howe ṭawwo, d mitawmar ëšmo mi ṣluṯo bu Holandoyo. It’ll be good, if a little bit of the prayer is said in Dutch. ܓܷܕ ܗܳܘܶܐ ܛܰܘܘܐ ܕܡܝܬܰܘܡܰܪ ܐܷܫܡܐ ܡܝ ܨܠܘܬ݂ܐ ܒܘ ܗܳܠܰܢܕܳܝܐ. 2. Irrealis conditional clauses In irrealis conditional clauses the verb is in the imperfect (G12.b) respectively plupreterite (G12.c) and the verb of the main clause in the conditional. The conditional is formed on the basis of the imperfect by adding the future preverb gëd ܓܷܕ . Morphologically, the conditional is derived from the imperfect just like the future from the present: Present goraš ܓܳܪܰܫ he pulls Future gëd goraš ܓܷܕ ܓܳܪܰܫ he will pull Imperfect gorašwa ܓܳܪܰܫܘܰܐ he used to pull Konditionalis gëd gorašwa ܓܷܕ ܓܳܪܰܫܘܰܐ he would pull/ he would have pulled Examples for irrealis conditional clauses: D howewayli zabno, g ëd koṯawwayno kṯowo. If I did have time, I would write a book. ܕܗܳܘܶܘܰܝܠܝ ܙܰܒܢܐ، ܓܷܕ ܟܳܬ݂ܰܘܘܰܝܢܐ ܟܬ݂ܳܘܐ. Iḏa d ëṯyatwa lu šuġlo, g ëd hoziwayna hḏoḏe. If you (fsg.) did come to work, we would see each other. ܐܝܕ݂ܰܐ ܕܐܷܬ݂ܝܰܬܘܰܐ ܠܘ ܫܘܓ݂ܠܐ، ܓܷܕ ܚܳܙܝܘܰܝܢܰܐ ܚܕ݂ܳܕ݂ܶܐ. D oṯewa ḥa mënxu lu knušyo, g ëd m šadriwayna alxu kṯowo acme. If one of you (pl.) had come to the meeting, we would have sent you (pl.) a book. ܕܐܳܬ݂ܶܘܰܐ ܚܰܐ ܡܷܢܟ݂ܘ ܠܘ ܟܢܘܫܝܐ، ܓܷܕ ܡܫܰܕܪܝܘܰܝܢܰܐ ܐܰܠܟ݂ܘ ܟܬ݂ܳܘܐ ܐܰܥܡܶܗ. D ṭorënwa mëštace u Afrem, annaqla ste gëd sëlqowa i gudayḏan darġo. Had they let Afrem play, our team too would have gone up a step. ܕܛܳܪܷܢܘܰܐ ܡܷܫܬܰܥܶܐ ܐܘ ܐܰܦܪܶܡ، ܐܰܢܢܰܩܠܰܐ ܣܬܶܐ ܓܷܕ ܣܷܠܩܳܘܰܐ ܐܝ ܓܘܕܰܝܕ݂ܰܢ ܕܰܪܓ݂ܐ. En d zërwalxu Ṭurcabdin, g ëd ëḏcituwa d layto tamo yamo lu sḥoyo. If you (pl.) had visited Turabdin, you (pl.) would know that there isn’t a lake for swimming. ܐܶܢ ܕܙܷܪܘܰܠܟ݂ܘ ܛܘܪܥܰܒܕܝܢ، ܓܷܕ ܐܷܕ݂ܥܝܬܘܘܰܐ ܕܠܰܝܬܐ ܬܰܡܐ ܝܰܡܐ ܠܘ ܣܚܳܝܐ. c) Negation 1. Nominal clauses Nominal clauses are clauses that are formed by means of a copula and a non-verbal predicate. These are negated using the negative copula: I raḏayto ḥaṯto yo. The car is new. ܐܝ ܪܰܕ݂ܰܝܬܐ ܚܰܬ݂ܬܐ ܝܐ. I raḏayto latyo ḥaṯto. The car isn’t new. ܐܝ ܪܰܕ݂ܰܝܬܐ ܠܰܬܝܐ ܚܰܬ݂ܬܐ. U Abrohëm kayiwo yo. Abrohëm is ill. ܐܘ ܐܰܒܪܳܗܷܡ ܟܰܝـܝܘܐ ܝܐ. U Abrohëm latyo kayiwo. Abrohëm isn’t ill. ܐܘ ܐܰܒܪܳܗܷܡ ܠܰܬܝܐ ܟܰܝـܝܘܐ. Aš šuqone rwiḥe ne. The streets are wide. ܐܰܫ ܫܘܩܳܢܶܐ ܪܘܝܚܶܐ ܢܶܐ. Aš šuqone latne rwiḥe. These streets aren’t wide. ܐܰܫ ܫܘܩܳܢܶܐ ܠܰܬܢܶܐ ܪܘܝܚܶܐ. 2. Verbal clauses Verbal clauses are negated by means of lo ܠܐ before the verbal predicate. Lašan di asiruṯo lo mëqṭoco , me zabno l zabno komtalfëni lë ḥḏoḏe. In order that they don’t loose touch (lit. their connection isn’t cut ), they call each other from time to time. ܠܰܫܰܢ ܕܐܝ ܐܰܣܝܪܘܬ݂ܐ ܠܐ ܡܷܩܛܳܥܐ، ܡܶܐ ܙܰܒܢܐ ܠܙܰܒܢܐ ܟܳܡܬܰܠܦܷܢܝ ܠܷܚܕ݂ܳܕ݂ܶܐ. Šërke lu tëcmiro lo mqafalle. They didn’t find a company to build. ܫܷܪܟܶܐ ܠܘ ܬܷܥܡܝܪܐ ܠܐ ܡܩܰܦܰܠܠܶܗ. I Saro w u Aday lo raḏën cal u plan du bayto. Saro and Aday didn’t agree on the building plan. ܐܝ ܣܰܪܐ ܘܐܘ ܐܰܕܰܝ ܠܐ ܪܰܕ݂ܷܢ ܥܰܠ ‌ܐܘ ܦ݁ܠܰܐܢ ܕܘ ܒܰܝܬܐ. B ceḏo zcuro u Aday lo zёrle u aḥunayḏe bu Swed. Aday didn’t visit his brother in Sweden for Christmas. ܒܥܶܕ݂ܐ ܙܥܘܪܐ ܐܘ ܐܰܕܰܝ ܠܐ ܙܷܪܠܶܗ ܐܘ ܐܰܚܘܢܰܝܕ݂ܶܗ ܒܘ ܣܘܶܕ. Qašti lo kuxlo basro bu ṣawmo. My grandma doesn’t eat meat during the fast. ܩܰܫܬܝ ܠܐ ܟܐܘܟ݂ܠܐ ܒܰܣܪܐ ܒܘ ܨܰܘܡܐ. When the predicate consists of an auxiliary and main verb, the negative particle precedes the auxiliary: I Saro w u Aday lo këbci zawni bayto. Saro and Aday don’t want to buy a house. ܐܝ ܣܰܪܐ ܘܐܘ ܐܰܕܰܝ ܠܐ ܟܷܐܒܥܝ ܙܰܘܢܝ ܒܰܝܬܐ. Ag gamle lo kolozam mita ḥti baq qlubye. The camels shouldn’t be put in cages. ܐܰܓ ܓܰܡܠܶܐ ܠܐ ܟܳܠܳܙܰܡ ܡܝܬܰܚܬܝ ܒܰܩ ܩܠܘܒܝܶܐ. I barṯaṯe lo komajro uxlo mede. This girl doesn’t dare eat something. ܐܝ ܒܰܪܬ݂ܰܬ݂ܶܐ ܠܐ ܟܳܡܰܔܪܐ ܐܘܟ݂ܠܐ ܡܶܕܶܐ. d) Negation of the future The future and present tense are not distinguished in negation. Both are expressed by lo ܠܐ + the actual present. lo kosoyam ܠܐ ܟܳܣܳܝܰܡ can thus also serve as the negative for kosoyam ܟܳܣܳܝܰܡ “he does, he’s doing” meaning “he doesn’t, he isn’t doing” or as the negative of gëd soyam ܓܷܕ ܣܳܝܰܡ “he will do” meaning “he won’t do”. The meaning must be determined contextually for each individual case. e) Negative preverb lo ܠܐ with initial vocalic verbs : The negative preverb lo ܠܐ fuses with the initial vowel of the negated verb, ending up as l- ܠ‍ـ . These verbs are spelled with Olaf / ܐ / in the Syriac script, representing the first radical even in such negated contracted forms. Also initial h- verbs howe - hawi ܗܳܘܶܐ - ܗܰܘܝ “be, become” and obe - hule ܐܳܒܶܐ - ܗܘܠܶܗ “give” follow this pattern: lo ab ë c ܠܐ ܐܰܒܷܥ > labëc ܠܰܐܒܷܥ „he didn’t want“ lo a ḏë c ܠܐ ܐܰܕ݂ܷܥ > laḏëc ܠܰܐܕ݂ܷܥ „he didn’t know“ lo a ṯ i ܠܐ ܐܰܬ݂ܝ > la ṯ i ܠܰܐܬ݂ܝ „he didn’t come“ lo hawi ܠܐ ܗܰܘܝ > lawi ܠܰܘܝ „he didn’t become“ lo hule ܠܐ ܗܘܠܶܗ > lule ܠܘܠܶܗ „he didn’t give“ lo omar ܠܐ ܐܳܡܰܪ > lomar ܠܳܐܡܰܪ „he won’t say“ lo o ṯ e ܠܐ ܐܳܬ݂ܶܐ > loṯe ܠܳܐܬ݂ܶܐ „he won’t come“ lo oxal ܠܐ ܐܳܟ݂ܰܠ > loxal ܠܳܐܟ݂ܰܠ „he won’t eat“ lo obac ܠܐ ܐܳܒܰܥ > lobac ܠܳܐܒܰܥ „he won’t want“ lo oḏac ܠܐ ܐܳܕ݂ܰܥ > loḏac ܠܳܐܕ݂ܰܥ „he won’t know“ lo howe ܠܐ ܗܳܘܶܐ > lowe ܠܳܘܶܐ „he won’t be“ Examples: Iḏa d lobac d oṯe, ṭro loṯe ! If he doesn’t want to come, then he should n’t come . ܐܝܕ݂ܰܐ ܕܠܳܐܒܰܥ ܕܐܳܬ݂ܶܐ، ܛܪܐ ܠܳܐܬ݂ܶܐ. I bälädiye lula fsoso lu tëcmiro.

Negation of the imperative of weak and irregular verbs Imperatives are negated using lo ܠܐ + the p resent base inflected for the second person (sg. respectively pl.) (G16.d) : graš! ܓܪܰܫ > lo guršat! ܠܐ ܓܘܪܫܰܬ grašu! ܓܪܰܫܘ > lo guršitu! ܠܐ ܓܘܪܫܝܬܘ The negative imperative thus follows the inflection of the present forms of the respective verbs. As discussed in Section G . 22e, the negation of initial Olaf ܐ verbs is slightly different . In these verbs the negator lo ܠܐ merges with the initial syllable of the present form ending up as l- ܠـ : lo ܠܐ + uxlat ܐܘܟ݂ܠܰܬ = luxlat ܠܐܘܟ݂ܠܰܬ “don’t eat!”. The Olaf ܐ is maintained in the Syriac spelling for etymological reasons. For more examples, see Section G . 22e . b) Object suffixes attached to the imperative Pronominal objects of the imperative are expressed by means of suffixes. These are the same object suffixes presented in Section G . 22a. The imperative singular has two distinct third person object suffixes, the first denotes the direct object (DO) (“Pull him !”, “Give it !”) and the second the indirect object (IO) (“Pull for him !” “Give to me !”). All other persons have only one form : Suffix Imperative sg. Imperative pl. 3.m.Sg. DO: gra š e ! ܓܪܰܫܶܗ grašu le ! ܓܪܰܫܘܠܶܗ IO: graš le ! ܓܪܰܫܠܶܗ 3.f.Sg.

DO/IO: gra š lan ! ܓܪܰܫܠܰܢ grašu lan ! ܓܪܰܫܘܠܰܢ Examples : DO: gra šli l Almanya! Take me to Germany ! ܓܪܰܫܠܝ ܠܐܰܠܡܰܐܢܝܰܐ IO: gra šli zuze mu otomat!

Go (m.) along with him to the shopping centre and find him a new cell phone ! ܙܘܟ݂ ܐܰܥܡܶܗ ܠܝ ܫܘܩܐ ܚܙܰܝܠܶܗ ܡܳܒܝܠ ܚܰܬ݂ܐ c) The 3 rd sg. copula yo ܝܐ and 3pl. copula ne ܢܶܐ can serve as second pronominal object Verbs that have an object suffix can take another pronominal object expressed by the third person copulas (G4.2b) sg. yo ܝܐ and pl. ne ܢܶܐ . This is written independently. The second object is always a direct object, the object suffix can only denote the indirect object : kogoraš He pulls. ܟܳܓܳܪܰܫ kogoraš lax He pulls you ( f.sg .)/for you ( f.sg .). ܟܳܓܳܪܰܫܠܰܟ݂ kogoraš lax ne He pulls them for you ( f.sg .). ܟܳܓܳܪܰܫܠܰܟ ܢܶܐ hula She gave. ܗܘܠܰܗ hula li She gave me. ܗܘܠܰܠܝ hula li yo She gave it to me. ܗܘܠܰܠܝ ܝܐ Examples : Ayko maḥatlux u kṯowo du mëlfono? Madcarli le yo ! Where have you (m.sg.) put the teacher’s book? I’ve given it back to him ! ܐܰܝܟܐ ܡܰܚܰܬܠܘܟ݂ ܐܘ ܟܬ݂ܳܘܐ ܕܘ ܡܷܠܦܳܢܐ؟ ܡܰܕܥܰܪܠܝܠܶܗ ܝܐ! U laḥmo aḥna gëd mamṭinan xu yo acman. The bread - we will take it along with us . ܐܘ ܠܰܚܡܐ ܐܰܚܢܰܐ ܓܷܕ ܡܰܡܛܝܢܰܢܟ݂ܘ ܝܐ ܐܰܥܡܰܢ. As sandwičat ḥoṯi zwënla lan ne mu otomat.

I told him: Give me your email address. He didn’t give it to me . ܡܷܪܠܝܠܶܗ ܗܰܘܠܝ ܐܘ ܐܝܡܰܝܠ ܕܝܕ݂ܘܟ݂، ܠܘܠܶܠܝ ܝܐ. d) The subjunctive 1. The subjunctive in general The subjunctive is formed on the basis of the present (G7.a), the bare present base. When the modifier d ܕ is placed before it, the subjunctive serves as a modal verb (“that I may…”) (G . 20c) or conditional (“if I…”) (G . 22c) depending on the context. The subjunctive is used in conditional clauses and other subordinate clauses but also independently to implore or encourage the listener ( e . g. “shall we?” or “let’s”), as well as in the imperative (after the negator lo- ܠܐ , “don’t!” G . 16d . 2) . Examples for the subjunctive : D rëḥmatle lo marfatle . If you (sg.) love him, don’t (sg.) leave him ! ܕܪܷܚܡܰܬܠܶܗ ܠܐ ܡܰܪܦܰܬܠܶܗ. Mën këmmat, saymina muklo dac ceḏe? What do you think, shall we make a banquet ? ܡܷܢ ܟܷܐܡܡܰܬ، ܣܰܝܡܝܢܰܐ ܡܘܟܠܐ ܕܰܥ ܥܶܕ݂ܶܐ؟ Gëd mëfṣoḥina d ḥozinanxu baynoṯayna. We will be delighted to see you among us . ܓܷܕ ܡܷܦܨܳܚـܝܢܰܐ ܕܚܳܙܝܢܰܢܟ݂ܘ ܒܰܝܢܳܬ݂ܰܝܢܰܐ. Mërlanle d oṯe , laṯi. We told him he should come but he didn’t . ܡܷܪܠܰܢܠܶܗ ܕܐܳܬ݂ܶܐ، ܠܰܐܬ݂ܝ. An nacime këbci d zawnina raḏayto ḥaṯto. The children want us to buy a new car . ܐܰܢ ܢܰܥܝܡܶܐ ܟܷܐܒܥܝ ܕܙܰܘܢܝܢܰܐ ܪܰܕ݂ܰܝܬܐ ܚܰܬ݂ܬܐ. Mšaralle d kurxi cal bayto. They began to look for a home . ܡܫܰܪܰܠܠܶܗ ܕܟܘܪܟ݂ܝ ܥܰܠ ܒܰܝܬܐ. Hiye ste kibe o ṯe lu knušyo. He too can come to the meeting . ܗܝܝܶܐ ܣܬܶܐ ܟܝܒܶܗ ܐܳܬ݂ܶܐ ܠܘ ܟܢܘܫܝܐ. 2. The particle ṭro ܛܪܐ added to the subjunctive The preverbal modifier ṭro ܛܪܐ together with the subjunctive functions as the ‘jussive’ (“should, let”). That is, it expresses desire, request, permission or obligation : Adlalyo ṭro domax gabayna. He should sleep at our place tonight . ܐܰܕܠܰܠܝܐ ܛܪܐ ܕܳܡܰܟ݂ ܓܰܒܰܝܢܰܐ. Klayu ṭro ucdo cëbrina . Wait, let us in now . ܟܠܰܝܘ ܛܪܐ ܐܘܥܕܐ ܥܷܒܪܝܢܰܐ. Bi qamayto kul ḥa ṭro konaš qëm u tarco d ruḥe. First everyone should sweep in front of his own door . ܒܝ ܩܰܡܰܝܬܐ ܟܘܠ ܚܰܐ ܛܪܐ ܟܳܢܰܫ ܩܷܡ ܐܘ ܬܰܪܥܐ ܕܪܘܚܶܗ. Ṭrëzze oxal bu bayto. He should go and eat at home . ܛܪܷܐܙܙܶܗ ܐܳܟ݂ܰܠ ܒܘ ܒܰܝܬܐ. Hawla qanyo ṭro këṯwo ëšma. Give her a pen, let her write down her name . ܗܰܘܠܰܗ ܩܰܢܝܐ ܛܪܐ ܟܷܬ݂ܘܐ ܐܷܫܡܰܗ. Az zamore ṭro zëmrilan zmarto umṯonayto. The singers should sing for us a patriotic song . ܐܰܙ ܙܰܡܳܪܶܐ ܛܪܐ ܙܷܡܪܝܠܰܢ ܙܡܰܪܬܐ ܐܘܡܬ݂ܳܢܰܝܬܐ. The particle ṭro ܛܪܐ fuses with the verbal form to a single word when combined with initial weak verbs. The first radical Olaf ܐ of the verb is maintained in Syriac writing : ṭro ܛܪܐ + oxal ܐܳܟ݂ܰܠ = ṭroxal ܛܪܳܐܟ݂ܰܠ „ let him eat “, ṭro ܛܪܐ + ëzze ܐܷܙܙܶܗ = ṭrëzze ܛܪܷܐܙܙܶܗ „ let him go “. Also , the form ṭrowe ܛܪܳܘܶܐ ( from ṭro howe ܛܪܐ ܗܳܘܶܐ „ let it be “) follows this procedure which is first mentioned in Lesson 8 and conveys the sense of “OK” or “All right” . 3. The adverb balki ܒܰܠܟܝ with the subjunctive Using the adverb balki ܒܰܠܟܝ “maybe, perhaps, could” together with the subjunctive indicates uncertainty or possibility : Balki oṯën lu wacdo w balki lo ṯën . Maybe they’re coming to the appointment, maybe they’re not . ܒܰܠܟܝ ܐܳܬ݂ܷܢ ܠܘ ܘܰܥܕܐ ܘܒܰܠܟܝ ܠܳܐܬ݂ܷܢ. Balki ḥozina ḥḏoḏe naqla ḥreto. Perhaps we’ll see each other again . ܒܰܠܟܝ ܚܳܙܝܢܰܐ ܚܕ݂ܳܕ݂ܶܐ ܢܰܩܠܰܐ ܚܪܶܬܐ. Marla, balki ma ḥto u vidyano bu YouTube.

Since when have you learned Surayt-Aramaic? ܡܐܶܡܰܐ ܟܳܝܷܠܦܰܬ ܣܘܪܰܝܬ؟ Note: The question word l ema ܠܐܶܡܰܐ “till when?” can be extended with the preposition hul ܗܘܠ “until” into hul l ema ܗܘܠ ܠܐܶܡܰܐ without a change in meaning: Hul l ema fayiši bu Swed? ܗܘܠ ܠܐܶܡܰܐ ܦܰܝـܝܫܝ ܒܘ ܣܘܶܕ؟ “Until when did they stay in Sweden?“ L man šqila i Saro dёšne?

Why did Aday make a call to Sweden? ܠܡܷܢ ܡܬܰܠܦܰܢܠܶܗ ܐܘ ܐܰܕܰܝ ܠܘ ܣܘܶܕ؟ 2. Direct speech without interrogative Interrogative sentences can also be formed without a question word. In that case you can tell from the intonation that you are dealing with a question. People generally raise the pitch of their voice at the end of an interrogative sentence. Yes/No-questions and choice questions belong to this group: 1) Yes-/No-questions: Sëmlaxlax ḥawrone? Have you (f.sg.) made yourself some friends? ܣܷܡܠܰܟ݂ܠܰܟ݂ ܚܰܘܪܳܢܶܐ؟ Bac csar ṭawwo yo? Is ten o’clock okay? ܒܰܥ ܥܣܰܪ ܛܰܘܘܐ ܝܳܐ؟ Fayëš mede? Is there anything left? ܦܰܝܷܫ ܡܶܕܶܐ؟ Ḥaḏiro hat? Are you (m.sg.) ready? ܚܰܕ݂ܝܪܐ ܗܰܬ؟ The question particle ma ܡܰܐ can be used to introduce yes/no-questions. There is no direct English equivalent of ma ܡܰܐ : Ma sëmlaxlax ḥawrone? Have you (f.sg.) made yourself some friends? ܡܰܐ ܣܷܡܠܰܟ݂ܠܰܟ݂ ܚܰܘܪܳܢܶܐ؟ Ma ḥaḏiro hat? Are you (m.sg.) ready? ܡܰܐ ܚܰܕ݂ܝܪܐ ܗܰܬ؟ 2) Choice questions: Šotina ucdo qaḥwa, aw qamayto kurxina bi mazracto? Shall we drink coffee now or shall we first walk around the farm? ܫܳܬܝܢܰܐ ܐܘܥܕܐ ܩܰܚܘܰܐ، ܐܰܘ ܩܰܡܰܝܬܐ ܟܘܪܟ݂ܝܢܰܐ ܒܝ ܡܰܙܪܰܥܬܐ؟ Gëd šotina Campari aw šampanya meqëm mu muklo? Are we going to drink Campari or champagne before we eat? ܓܷܕ ܫܳܬܝܢܰܐ ܟܰܡܦ݁ܰܪܝ ܐܰܘ ܫܰܡܦ݁ܰܐܢܝܰܐ ܡܶܩܷܡ ܡܘ ܡܘܟܠܐ؟ Gëd fayšitu aw gëd ëzzoxu? Are you (pl.) staying or are you (pl.) going? ܓܷܕ ܦܰܝܫܝܬܘ ܐܰܘ ܓܷܕ ܐܷܙܙܳܟ݂ܘ؟ b) Questions in indirect speech Interrogative sentences are introduced by be ܒܶܐ in indirect speech: Lo mërlelan be gëd oṯe acman l Ṭurcabdin. He didn’t tell us whether he would come along to Turabdin. ܠܐ ܡܷܪܠܶܠܰܢ ܒܶܐ ܓܷܕ ܐܳܬ݂ܶܐ ܐܰܥܡܰܢ ܠܛܘܪܥܰܒܕܝܢ. Ḥzay be kit noše bu bayto. Look whether there’s somebody inside the house. ܚܙܰܝ ܒܶܐ ܟܝܬ ܢܳܫܶܐ ܒܘ ܒܰܝܬܐ. Mšayeli mënne be maṭi u e-mailayḏi. I asked them whether my email arrived. ܡܫܰܝܶܠܝ ܡܷܢܢܶܗ ܒܶܐ ܡܰܛܝ ܐܘ ܐܝܡܰܝܠܰܝܕ݂ܝ. Kibux d ëmmatli be këtla smartphone i barṯayḏux? Could you (msg.) tell me whether your daughter has a smartphone? ܟܝܒܘܟ݂ ܕܐܷܡܡܰܬܠܝ ܒܶܐ ܟܷܬܠܰܗ ܣܡܰܐܪܬܦܳܢ ܐܝ ܒܰܪܬ݂ܰܝܕ݂ܘܟ݂؟ Lo këḏcina be košote ḥamro aw bira. We don’t know whether he drinks wine or beer. ܠܐ ܟܷܐܕ݂ܥܝܢܰܐ ܒܶܐ ܟܳܫܳܬܶܐ ܚܰܡܪܐ ܐܰܘ ܒܝܪܰܐ. The particle be ܒܶܐ , however, can also be omitted in indirect speech when combined with one of the above interrogatives: Lo koḏacno ( be) man gëd oṯe. I don’t know who’s coming. ܠܐ ܟܳܐܕ݂ܰܥܢܐ (ܒܶܐ) ܡܰܢ ܓܷܕ ܐܳܬ݂ܶܐ. Lo šamicina ( be) m ën mërle u mëjġalyono. We didn’t hear what the speaker said. ܠܐ ܫܰܡܝܥܝܢܰܐ (ܒܶܐ) ܡܷܢ ܡܷܪܠܶܗ ܐܘ ܡܷܔܓ݂ܰܠܝܳܢܐ. Kibax ëmmatli ( be) ema gëd ḥozina ḥḏoḏe? Could you (sg.) tell me when we’ll see each other? ܟܝܒܰܟ݂ ܐܷܡܡܰܬܠܝ (ܒܶܐ) ܐܶܡܰܐ ܓܷܕ ܚܳܙܝܢܰܐ ܚܕ݂ܳܕ݂ܶܐ؟ Fahimat ( be) qay aṯyo i Marta l Berlin? Did you (sg.) understand why Marta came to Berlin? ܦܰܗܝܡܰܬ (ܒܶܐ) ܩܰܝ ܐܰܬ݂ܝܐ ܐܝ ܡܰܪܬܰܐ ܠܒܶܪܠܝܢ؟ c) Presentative kale The presentative copula kale ܟܰܠܶܗ “look, there (he) is” is inflected by means of the L-suffixes: Sg. 3. m. ka le ܟܰܠܶܗ 3. f. ka la ܟܰܠܰܗ 2. m. ka lux ܟܰܠܘܟ݂ 2. f. ka lax ܟܰܠܰܟ݂ 1. ka li ܟܰܠܝ Pl. 3. ka lën ܟܰܠܷܢ 2. ka loxu ܟܰܠܳܟ݂ܘ 1. ka lan ܟܰܠܰܢ Unlike the other L-suffixes (G.8a), this particle takes a 2 nd pl. suffix loxu ܠܳܟ݂ܘ .. The stress is always on the last syllable. Kale ܟܰܠܶܗ is used in verbal and non-verbal sentences. In both cases the focus is on the observed situation in the present. 1. kale ܟܰܠܶܗ in non-verbal clauses Kale ܟܰܠܶܗ functions like the copula in non-verbal clauses and expresses the present assertively drawing the listener’s attention (“Look here/there!”): Kale bu bayto. (= Bu bayto yo. ) He’s home already. (He’s at home.) ܟܰܠܶܗ ܒܘ ܒܰܝܬܐ. (= ܒܘ ܒܰܝܬܐ ܝܐ. ) Kalën ġäläbe šafire ab bënyonani. (= Ab bënyonani ġäläbe šafire ne . ) These buildings are truly very beautiful. (These buildings are very beautiful.) ܟܰܠܷܢ ܓ݂ܱܠܱܒܶܐ ܫܰܦܝܪܶܐ ܐܰܒ ܒܷܢܝܳܢܰܢܝ. (= ܐܒ ܒܷܢܝܳܢܰܢܝ ܓ݂ܱܠܱܒܶܐ ܫܰܦܝܪܶܐ ܢܶܐ. ) Kali harke. (= Harke no. ) Here I am! (I am here.) ܟܰܠܝ ܗܰܪܟܶܐ. (= ܗܰܪܟܶܐ ܢܐ. ) Kale ܟܰܠܶܗ often combines with participles (non-finite verbal forms) of position and motion verbs: Kale mžido cal u taxt . (= mžido yo ... ) He’s already lying in bed. (He’s lying…). ܟܰܠܶܗ ܡܙ̰ܝܕܐ ܥܰܠ ‌ܐܘ ܬܰܟ݂ܬ. = ܡܙ̰ܝܕܐ ܝܐ … Kale yatiwo cal u kursi. (= yatiwo yo ... ) Look here! He’s sitting on the chair. (He’s seated…) ܟܰܠܶܗ ܝܰܬܝܘܐ ܥܰܠ ܐܘ ܟܘܪܣܝ . = ܝܰܬܝܘܐ ܝܐ … Kalën azole l Ṭurcabdin. (= azole ne ... ) They’re already on their way to Turabdin. (They’re going…) ܟܰܠܷܢ ܐܰܙܳܠܶܐ ܠܛܘܪܥܰܒܕܝܢ. = ܐܰܙܳܠܶܐ ܢܶܐ... Kala aṯayto l Almanya. (= aṯayto yo ... ) She’s about to come to Germany. (She’s coming…) ܟܰܠܰܗ ܐܰܬ݂ܰܝܬܐ ܠܐܰܠܡܰܐܢܝܰܐ. = ܐܰܬ݂ܰܝܬܐ ܝܐ … 2. kale ܟܰܠܶܗ in verbal clauses Kale ܟܰܠܶܗ can be used in combination with present and preterite verbal forms, particularly to indicate that the situation is still in progress or happened recently: Kale koṯe. Here he comes. ܟܰܠܶܗ ܟܳܐܬܶܗ Kalën kuxli. They’re still eating now. ܟܰܠܷܢ ܟܐܘܟ݂ܠܝ Kalan xilan. We’ve just finished eating. ܟܰܠܰܢ ܟ݂ܝܠܰܢ Kala maḥkela be mën hawi acmi. She has just told what happened to me. ܟܰܠܰܗ ܡܰܚܟܶܠܰܗ ܒܶܐ ܡܷܢ ܗܰܘܝ ܐܰܥܡܝ. Kale sxërle u tarco. He has just closed the door. ܟܰܠܶܗ ܣܟ݂ܷܪܠܶܗ ܐܘ ܬܰܪܥܐ. d) Other negative particles 1. haw ܗܰܘ and law ܠܰܘ „not anymore“ The invariant particles haw ܗܰܘ and law ܠܰܘ “not anymore, no longer” are synonymous and follow the same rules as lo ܠܐ (see G.22c): Haw / law kocawdo adyawma. She’s no longer working today. ܗܰܘ / ܠܰܘ ܟܳܥܰܘܕܐ ܐܰܕܝܰܘܡܰܐ. Haw / law koxal basro. He doesn’t eat meat anymore. ܗܰܘ / ܠܰܘ ܟܳܐܟ݂ܰܠ ܒܰܣܪܐ. Nošo haw / law foraqwa d latyo Berlinayto. People would no longer notice that she wasn’t a Berliner. ܢܳܫܐ ܗܰܘ / ܠܰܘ ܦܳܪܰܩܘܰܐ ܕܠܰܬܝܐ ܒܶܪܠܝܢܰܝܬܐ. 2. Combinations with lo ܠܐ . Negative predicates that start with lo ܠܐ (see G22.c) can be extended by adding the particles hič ܗܝܫ̰ and bë ḥḏo naqla ܒܷܚܕ݂ܐ ܢܰܩܠܰܐ (“not ever”, “not at all”, “absolutely/certainly not”) and të ܬܷܐ (“not any at all”) to draw the listener’s attention to the negation by making it absolute. 1) Examples with hič ܗܝܫ̰ : Caṣriyawoṯe hi č lo koxal muklo. In the evening he doesn’t eat food at all. ܥܰܨܪܝـܝܰܘܳܬ݂ܶܐ ܗܝܫ̰ ܠܐ ܟܳܐܟ݂ܰܠ ܡܘܟܠܐ. B lalyo hi č lo komadcar cal u täläfon. At night he never answers my phone call. ܒܠܰܠܝܐ ܗܝܫ̰ ܠܐ ܟܳܡܰܕܥܰܪ ܥܰܠ ‌ܐܘ ܬܱܠܱܦܳܢ. 2) Examples with bë ḥḏo naqla ܒܷܚܕ݂ܐ ܢܰܩܠܰܐ : U qaloco du bësëklet b ë ḥḏo naqla lo ḥzelan. We haven’t seen the cyclist at all. ܐܘ ܩܰܠܳܥܐ ܕܘ ܒܷܣܷܟܠܶܬ ܒܷܚܕ݂ܐ ܢܰܩܩܰܐ ܠܐ ܚܙܶܠܰܢ. Bë ḥḏo naqla lo kokoṯawno bu Facebook. I (m.) don’t write on Facebook at all. ܒܷܚܕ݂ܐ ܢܰܩܠܰܐ ܠܐ ܟܳܟܳܬ݂ܰܘܢܐ ܒܘ ܦܰܝܣܒܘܟ. Note: You can use both particles hič ܗܝܫ̰ and bë ḥḏo naqla ܒܷܚܕ݂ܐ ܢܰܩܠܰܐ interchangeably without a distinction in meaning. 3) Examples with të ܬܷܐ : B Berlin t ë nošo lo mcawanlelan. In Berlin nobody helped us at all. ܒܒܶܪܠܝܢ ܬܷܐ ܢܳܫܐ ܠܐ ܡܥܰܘܰܢܠܶܠܰܢ. Të mede lo fahimitu mi kṯawtayḏi. You haven’t understood anything of my text at all. ܬܷܐ ܡܶܕܶܐ ܠܐ ܦܰܗܝܡܝܬܘ ܡܝ ܟܬ݂ܰܘܬܰܝܕ݂ܝ. Të mede lo yalëf lašan u buḥrono . He didn’t learn anything for the test at all. ܬܷܐ ܡܶܕܶܐ ܠܐ ܝܰܠܷܦ ܠܰܫܰܢ ܐܘ ܒܘܚܪܳܢܐ. An nacime t ë ḥalwo lo štalle. The children haven’t drunk any milk at all. ܐܰܢ ܢܰܥܝܡܶܐ ܬܷܐ ܚܰܠܘܐ ܠܐ ܫܬܰܠܠܶܗ. Note: The particle të ܬܷܐ can only be used together with nouns. Hič ܗܝܫ̰ can also be used instead of të ܬܷܐ .", "1. aydarbo", "how?"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["1. aydarbo", "how?", "ܐܰܝܕܰܪܒܐ"]}, {"type": "table_row", "cells": ["2. ayko", "where?",
